So in your opinion, the polls are correct about Bernie having had better odds than Trump? Then why weren't the polls correct about  HRC having better odds than Trump?

> Bernie Sander's wasn't a socialist, and it's unlikely the voters would have taken the media any more seriously labeling him that than they did when the media labelled Trump a sexist.

Trump didn't go around saying "I am a sexist." Sanders (maybe mistakenly) openly called himself a socialist, and the GOP will hammer that in. That's pretty hard to get around. And [#1#50% of Americans will not vote for a socialist even if the candidate is otherwise "generally well-qualified."#1# Americans hate socialist candidates more than Muslim, atheist, or gay ones.](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/29/jennifer-granholm/jennifer-granholm-says-americans-would-rather-elec/)

Even if Sanders is closer to a hardline liberal, most voters don't care that much to do independent research. What they will know is that Bernie Sanders has openly declared himself a socialist.

> We have to reevaluate what a traditional campaign is worth in the face of these results.

Bloomberg could never have won. But Bloomberg may allow Trump to win a state like Virginia (where Trump lost by 4.9%), or may himself win a single state, like New York (where Sanders lost by 15.9%). If Bloomberg costs Sanders just 10 electoral votes, Trump wins.
