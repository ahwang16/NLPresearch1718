I think Bernie stood a much better chance for a few simple reasons.

-Hillary Clinton is hated by a large segment of the population. #1#Whereas Bernie is far and away the most [popular]#1#(http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2016/09/most_and_least-liked_us_senato.html) senator in the US.

-He promoted economic populism, whereas she promoted more-or-less a continuance of the same old.

-He has no baggage surrounding him, no scandals, no sign that he was hiding anything.

-He spoke directly to the working class white males directly, and reached out to conservative voters. I don't remember Hillary visiting Alabama or Louisiana to campaign.

-He was wildly popular, he had people raving about *policy* not personal attacks, whereas Hillary couldn't fire up a crowd if her life depended on it.

-He was huge with every demographic except minorities, specifically black Americans,  who he was making inroads with.

-But mostly, nobody likes Clinton. Nobody trusts her. In a year where, literally all over the world, people are saying eff-you to every establishment political order all over the world, Clinton was the most establishment candidate that you could field. Anywhere. In spite of what they tell you, we haven't recovered from the so called Great Recession, people are still hurting. And at some point to people you have to burn the system down to get your point across. To tell them that your way isn't working. Bernie was inspiring left version, now we have to deal with violent right version.

Edit:

I also want to remind you that Bernie won MI, WI, and very nearly Iowa. All states that Clinton should've beaten Bernie in handily. They showed how weak she was in the midwest. Nobody thought he'd do well in MI until he won it in an upset. The proverbial canary in the coal mine, and everybody ignored it.
