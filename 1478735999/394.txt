>Even if I were to accept that a female president would be some sort of "victory", why is that more important than a first Jewish president, or Muslim president, or Arabic president, or Latino president, or Asian president? Why are the needs of women more important than the needs of those groups and others?

Who says it is? Also, women are 50% of the population. All things being equal, close to 50% of presidents should have been women, but obviously that hasn't been the case for historical and cultural reasons. 

A female president would prove that those barriers have broken down, and show that women in this country really can do anything; a female president would serve as a role model for young girls who feel disheartened about living in a "man's world" due to this enormous statistical discrepancy.
