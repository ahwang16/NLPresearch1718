If that was the goal, wouldn't you say it was far more important to elect an arabic president then? Heck a majority of America probably doesn't even know the difference between arab and muslim. And clearly there is a lot more vitriol towards arabs than women.

Unless your view is that since there are more women than arabs, this makes women's issues more important I don't see why (in the context of president) that a female would be more important than an arab.

But if this is your view, now it would bring up the issue of why one would feel the majority should get priority simply because they are the majority...
