There's really nothing wrong with not voting if you truly don't care about the direction of our country. The problem is that people who don't vote still complain about our government, and feel as if their voices are not being heard.  Of course your voices aren't being heard, you haven't made your needs or desires know to our elected officials. 

It's so ludicrous that people except things to change when they won't take a few hours out of a single day once every 2 to 4 years. Of course being informed is best, but you don't even need to be actively involved in the political process to have your voice heard. Believe in marriage equality? Go vote liberal. Don't believe in abortion? Go vote conservative. 

Just absolutely do not complain about how Washington and politicians do their jobs, when you can't be bothered to do yours. 

"Don't boo. Vote."
