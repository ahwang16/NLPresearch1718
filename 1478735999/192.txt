> what do you suggest liberals do? We care about living in a country where marginalized people feel safe and welcome... we think it's wrong when someone infringes on that, and Trump's language certainly did, in many ways. Do you want us to not think that's wrong? If it's ok that we think it's wrong, do you want us to not say out loud that it's wrong? If we see someone excusing it or ignoring it, should we just not speak up about the thing we think is most important about the dude?

I think people should do this on an individual basis. I don't think the standard bearer of the party should be advocating and encouraging it. Everyone knew Trump was horrid. Clinton should have just talked policy and let social and mass media chew him up for his comments.
