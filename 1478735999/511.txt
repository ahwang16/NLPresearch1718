I am ex pat in China so I can give some perspective on things. 

China allows some western movies in because simply they make money. There is some soft power, but every movie screen in China is there by the grace of the government. For instance Deadpool didn't make the cut. 

Every month there are around one or two western movies one can see and like 6 Chinese ones. 

Then again China being China sometimes edits certain things or restricts what type of movies can be made. 

That's why there is a Journey to the West all the time or the 40th ww2 movie where the Chinese are kicking Japanese ass.
