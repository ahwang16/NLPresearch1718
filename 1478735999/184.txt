No, it's not. Being called a racist or a sexist isn't abuse. It may be an asshole move, but calling it abuse is a ridiculous false equivalency.

Now, if someone got fired, disowned, or assaulted for their beliefs, absolutely 100% I agree that that's abuse (and in some cases criminal. Political violence has zero fucking excuse) . But I don't think that's what we're talking about here. I know a lot of people were rude and vitriolic, but none of the abuse victims I saw were actually abusing trump supporters.
