I think you're on the right track, but have the wrong ending. 

Unfortunately, President-elect Trump has said things that encourage racism and sexism. While you might not believe them, some supporters do. If Hillary had won, this would be a post about how she appealed to a broader base than Trump, or had better ideas. But she didn't. 

Like I said you are on the right track.  MSM polls always supported Clinton, and late night comedy loved to make fun of Trump. Because of they thought she had it in the bag easily, people just didn't turn up. Day of voter turnout was lower for her than Obama, especially in minority groups.That isn't people voting for Trump. Not only that but, the group that was  consistent from 2008 and 2012 to 2016 was white voters.

She was also viewed as an insider, when most people wanted significant change. Bernie and Obama promised change. Voters who were excited by Bernie, voted for third party. Johnson went from 1.5% of the vote to 3.9%. If that 2.4% had stayed with Hillary, she would have won. If they didn't vote third-party, they stayed at home. Those who voted for Trump did so because they were motivated, either by his rhetoric or dislike of liberals. 

Hopefully this changes your view.
