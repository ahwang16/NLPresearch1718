No, again, that was the emphasis of the MEDIA. Her website was rife with policy that had NOTHING to do with Trump. The media on the other hand pretty much only emphasised the nevertrump aspect of it. People say the media is biased, and they're right. It's biased towards money, and watching reporting on policy is bad for money.
