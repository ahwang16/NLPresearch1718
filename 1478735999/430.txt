Oh..indeed.  Lets absolutely change some things to encourage more women to run for president.  Agreed!

So...there is at least sexism here. If we need encouragement to get women to run then that itself exposes a problem. I'd call things on face sexist if it has so disproportionately encouraged men and women to run.  That's not your issue, but its important.  We don't escape sexism here by looking at the odds in your framing.

So...firstly, I'm not sure thats thats the narrative.  The narrative I see is that "sexism is part of reason for the outcome" or "sexism plays a big part in how character traits about hilary get interpreted".  

But...even then, if _we are sometimes sexist_ in that applies to our judgment, as it must if we are, then what do we do.  We can encourage all day but if we are unwilling to vote for a women than we've got a problem, eh?  There is a lot of evidence for things like men will cross party lines to vote for men, but not to vote for women.  Or women's chances of winning decrease with media coverage in local races where as men's increases. Or women win a bit more than 35% of the time in 2 person elections against men.
