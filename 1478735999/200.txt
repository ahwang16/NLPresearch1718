>Not quite. You're being called horrible things because you cared more about that couple of percentage points of taxes than you cared about the safety and lives of minorities whose parents may now get deported, lgbt individuals who likely may have rights rolled back, women who may no longer be able to gain access to abortions etc.

In other words, he is self-interested, just like everyone else. There is a reason why most feminists are women, why most most BLM activists are black, and why most LGBT activists are LGBT. People care most about things that they have a personal stake in. 

You're right, it's kind of shitty. But it's also basic psychology. If you want to sway someone to your side you have to talk about *them*. The SJW crowd and Hillary "going after the banks won't end racism" miss this point even further by demonizing anyone who doesn't immediately and blindly adopt thier stances as a monster, without really trying to explain these issues from a different perspective i.e. check your privilege, mansplaining.

While her campaign slogan was "Stronger Together" the loud and clear message was "Shut Up. My Problems Are More Important."
