&#8710; My mind hasn't been changed, but it has been largely swayed. It's certainly true, as evidenced by jay520, that, as you say, all the bigots voted for Trump. I wouldn't have refuted that before, but the amount of bigots that glommed onto him in the primaries was eye opening to me. 

I guess what I didn't realize until I posted here was that what angers me about a lot of peoples' reactions. The people I see decrying the end of the world are middle and upper middle class white people (I too am middle class and white, BTW). I live in a very blue state, and I don't think that these people consider *for a second* that there are large parts of the population who don't think like them, and that that doesn't make those people bad or wrong or misguided. It's the worst of part of our liberal tendencies, this smug, *my way is the right way, and I am here to save you from yourself* sort of attitude.
