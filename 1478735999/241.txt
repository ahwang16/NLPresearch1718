> If liberals aren't allowed to call someone racist when they say that a judge can't do their job because of their ethnicity, when can they?

I would say this is a valid reason, as it is a conflict of interest. It is not like he said " you are genetically unfit to be a judge" or something like that.

But regardless of whether or not it was motivated by racism, I think it is fair to say it really annoyed many people and got them to vote Trump. Shaming might be effective at silencing Trump supporters and discouraging them from publicly stating support, but it won't stop them from voting.
