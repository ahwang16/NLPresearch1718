This isn't relevant. Not only does popular vote just not matter in an electorate race, but voter and candidate behavior is *influenced* by it being an electorate race. I'm sure many voters in California, Texas, and New York's minority parties stay home because their vote counts for little, and candidates campaign in a way that's uninterested in producing bigger overall turnouts, just turnouts in important states.

I can't say which direction the popular vote would swing in a voting system based on it, but the current popular vote is neither relevant to the discussion of the winner nor is it representative of the actual preferences of voters.
