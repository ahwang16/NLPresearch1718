I think the problem has to do with the silent majority effect. You stayed silent, so people only heard the racist, sexist, xenophobic supporters. I can't speak for other people, but my experience has been that whenever someone said something racist, sexist, or fascist on this site, they were almost guaranteed to be a regular on The Donald. Any time spent in online pro-Trump spaces will make any outsider very quickly aware of a strong "fuck everyone who isn't us" mentality.

I'm open to the possibility that there's a strong contingent of moderate Trump supporters who have an interest in making sure his worst tendencies are kept in check, and I'm sure far more people would think the same way if those supporters spoke up.
