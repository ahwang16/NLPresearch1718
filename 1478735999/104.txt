1. Stories are fun! Your comparison to TV is apt in this regard - many people watch TV to be entertained. Not everyone does, and you may not enjoy reading fiction, but that doesn't make it pointless.

2. Stories are the way humans assimilate data. Pure information is useless unless it is arranged to tell a story. For example, I could look up all the events of the Holocaust, the number of deaths, the locations of concentration camps etc. without it meaning anything to me. It takes a story about a holocaust (one that doesn't even have to be historical) to get me to understand just how wrong it is, without having to experience it. A statistic is just a number, only a story can be a tragedy.

3. A story is not just the thoughts of an author, but also conveys the context the author is writing in, often sub-textually. What is important to them is different than what is important to me, and those differences will stand out to me as I read, and make me think about my own context and why I see the world the way I do. So a story, especially a fictional one, helps me learn more about my biases and my world.

In summary, fiction is art, extracted skillfully from the mind just as much as a painting, a sculpture, or a piece of music. Art is what connects human emotions to reality, allows us to empathize with people we will never meet but may vastly affect, and, in the end, changes our views.
