CMV: I DON'T THINK ELECTING A FEMALE PRESIDENT IS IMPORTANT

So just some quick math, if say a total of 10 people ran for president on average every election (includes the primaries, and I have no idea what the actual number is), that would mean that 470 people have ran for president. Since 5 women have run, that would mean that 1% of the candidates have been women. Wouldn't that explain the 0?

To put it another way, why is the narrative automatically "we need to help end sexism in America with a female president", and not "let's change some things to encourage more women to run for president"?
