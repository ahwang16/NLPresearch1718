Protests aren't a real belief that Donald Trump will resign or change his mind. They're not for Donald Trump. They're for the people who voted against Trump, as a reminder to the masses that there exists a large contingent of people who strongly oppose his views and behavior. It's to remind immigrants that many Americans do welcome them to the country. It's to remind people of color that there are many who want to be their allies in their ongoing struggles with the racism in the institutions and minds of the people of the USA. It's to motivate and mobilize an electorate into continued action leading up to the midterm elections and then 2020.

If you argue with an internet troll, it seems pointless. That troll is never going to change their mind. But 95% of the time, the argument isn't to change the mind of the troll, but to change the mind of the spectators.
