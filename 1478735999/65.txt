Well, Trump's position in 2016 was so strong that even if we factor out all the states he barely won (by only 2% or less), [Trump has 230 votes.](http://www.270towin.com/maps/Op4DE) It's easy for him to win Florida, where Sanders lost the primaries by over 30% (and Sanders has a hard time with black voters). He has 259 votes now, all without Pennsylvania, Michigan, or Wisconsin. 

All it takes is for Trump to win just *one* of those three states, or for Bloomberg to take 10 normally blue votes. Then it's over for Bernie.
