Sadly, a lot of where she underperformed with minorities were men. Some of that was likely sexism. Others were people staying home in the South -- yeah, they'll come out for their token vote to Obama in Alabama but maybe it's not worth it to come out to the polls for Bernie or Hillary. Either way, AL doesn't matter. Turnout there being down doesn't matter. 

Also, a lot of the reason she was more popular than Sanders was the "electability" factor. I live in a closed primary state, and I confess I supported Sanders but almost voted for Clinton in the primary (ultimately did vote for Sanders) because I was convinced by many Dems in my area who liked Sanders well enough that he was unelectable. I doubt this was a phenomenon only I experienced.
