> The majority of Americans knew and know little about Sanders other than that he is "anti-establishment" and opposed HRC during the primaries. Neither Hillary nor the Reps attacked him hard publicly, since Hillary wanted Sanders's support and the Republicans wanted Sanders to weaken Hillary's standing.

I think we have a clear answer already as to whether past behavior means more to voters than policies. The man who is currently the president elect ran a scam for-profit school, screwed over legions of small businesses and contractors and copped to being a sexual assaulter on video.

What Sanders scandal could have compared to all of this? To any one of these? And if voters ignored destabilizing, classless behavior like marching your opponent's homewreckers in for her debate, what was supposed to inspire their moral outrage?

>Add to that that only a third of Americans have a favorable view of socialism

Bernie Sander's wasn't a socialist, and it's unlikely the voters would have taken the media any more seriously labeling him that than they did when the media labelled Trump a sexist.  

>Bloomberg would most likely have run and taken away at least some of the left-leaning money and votes antagonized by Sanders's rhetoric, 

Hillary had the largest election machine that's ever been built. Trump didn't even have a ground game. We have to reevaluate what a traditional campaign is worth in the face of these results.

These questions show that we have a very different opinion of what Bernie's power was. I believe fully that Bernie whatever story the machine tried to spin the exact same way that Trump did, except they would have had to rely on bullshit while Donald Trump is loud and proud about his character failures.
