My question is simply what makes this different from any other president? Or any other leader? Or any other person people look up to?

Hell, I can suggest most married people overlook many of the shitty things their s/o does. 

So, what makes Trump supporters unique, first of all, from Obama supporters who act like Obama has fulfilled everything and done so much when others suggest he has actually regressed? 

I don't think this is arguable because it's too applicable to too many similar things revolving around putting your faith into someone or something. 

Some parents believe their child, raping, murdering, assaulting everyone, is still a good person. Not all but this isn't unique, it's psychological and applicable to many things. 

So, yes, many Trump supporters, if he breaks every promise, will still support him. Just like the last place hockey team still has fans claiming they are, actually, the best.
