You misunderstood. My point is that, if the population is 50% women, and we lived in a hypothetical world where men and women are and have always been actually equal, the odds of a list of 45 individuals being 100% men is statistically unlikely. So obviously there is a cultural bias against women to create that discrepancy. 

The point of this statement was to illustrate that not having had a female president is not the same as not having had a racial minority president, because there are statistically fewer racial minorities.
