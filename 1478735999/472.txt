I realize many voters voted for Trump because he made sensational racist comments, but I have family and friends who I know voted for him in spite of his racist comments. Now that Trump has been elected he needs to change his rhetoric to condemn any hate crime that occurs, including those he may have inspired. If he does not, people need to take to the streets, and those who voted for him in spite of his inflammatory statements have the heaviest moral obligation to speak out if they do in fact believe in civil rights.
