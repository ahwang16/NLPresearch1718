Yeah, I find it really interesting how this guy seems to have totally missed the language like "cuck" and "libtard" being slung constantly around by Trump's supporters towards Bernie and Hillary supporters, let alone slogans like "Trump That Bitch" and "Don't Vote for the Lying Witch" about Clinton personally. 

Hell, I'm old enough to remember when Rush Limbaugh held up a photograph of 12 year old Chelsea Clinton and called her "the white house dog". There's a decades-long history of the most vile and misogynistic rhetoric you can imagine being flung at the Clinton women, but somehow it's liberals who are being rude and condescending for daring to call hate hate.
