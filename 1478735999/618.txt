Third parties have no chance of just jumping to the top. Yes it is a waist of your vote to vote third party for president but there are so many other elected positions out there locally that stand a good chance of being elected from a third party.  And slowly those groups can move up the ranks of politics until there is actually a chance of them contending for president.
