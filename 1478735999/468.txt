We are a representative democracy not a pure/direct democracy.... I think we should elect based on total vote, but you can't do that after the fact. Both candidates would have run their campaigns completely differently if they were simply trying to drive up voting numbers rather than fighting for battleground states.

There is validation to both the electoral college and the popular vote. I prefer the Approval Voting system.
