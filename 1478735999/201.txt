I gotta say, nothing makes me stop trying to have a discussion with someone more than when they use a phrase like "SJW feminist" or someone saying an argument is mansplaining or anyone uttering or typing the phrase "check your privilege."

These buzzwords basically invalidate the person they are being used against altogether and show that you can't have a reasonable discussion with them.

People need to learn that, if they want to be taken seriously, they need to practice forming constructive debate using fact and logic and reason instead of insult and shame and guilty. 

(You were not doing this in any way, it just reminded me of why I hate those phrases)
