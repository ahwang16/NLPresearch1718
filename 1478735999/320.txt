I completely agree that the DNC is not listening to their base, and it's not working into attracting the GOP's base either.

But I responded to OP, and that's not what OP was writing about. OP was writing about "Liberal smugness/condescension/shaming" rather than the DNC pursuing establishment politics. So I don't see how I have misunderstood; rather, I think you are ignoring the context, which is OP's post.
