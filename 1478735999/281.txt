The only thing that contributed to Trump's victory is the people that made the conscious choice to vote him in. This here is more than a simple affirmation that "pandering to people make them vote for you". It's laying the responsibility for the election at the feet of the opposing side and saying "here, look what you did". As if Trump supporters are some kind of naturally occurring phenomenon that ought to be controlled rather than grown individuals making actual choices. 

Again, what are you to do with a voting base motivated by spite ?
