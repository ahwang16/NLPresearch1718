> And that's why I celebrate that there are now four women of color in the Senate (one Somali American, one Indian American, and one Thai American join a Hawaiian lady) along with the first ever Latinx person to serve in the Senate. Similarly, I celebrate the first openly LGBT person to become a mayor.

Agreed, I think this is great. What I especially like is that it happened naturally. Wouldn't it feel a little less impactful if they were elected *because* of their ethnicity/orientation though? Isn't it better when they are the best person for the position, and also just happen to be X?

It's a little hard to explain, and I don't think I'm doing it well, so maybe some examples would help:

- I didn't like the Ghostbusters cast, becasause I felt the casting rule was "all 4 actors must be women". This is as offensive to me as if it was "all 4 actors must be straight white men". The particular ethnicity/gender/orientation being favored makes no difference to me, I never want them to be favored arbitrarily (obviously if the gender, etc.. is central to the story it isn't arbitrary anymore). I want 4 actors that are best for the role, who happen to be female.

- One of my favorite movies of all time is The Pursuit of Happyness. The reason I liked it was much is because of how ethnicity was never brought up and was never an issue, when it would have been so easy to lean on that. The main character is a person who went through extreme hardship and worked hard to overcome it. The fact that he is also black wasn't relevant.

I don't know if that helps to explain my position or not, hopefully it helps a little
