> There's nothing inherently racist about stop and frisk

It was ruled by the Supreme Court as racist. You would have to be willfully ignorant to believe that it isn't racist.

And yes, banning all Muslims because a small group of them is incredibly, INCREDIBLY xenophobic. Matter of fact it's the literal definition of xenophobia - fear of people from other countries.

I mean... what would it take to convince you of ANYTHING he says as being racist? There's always SOME way the things he says and does aren't somehow racist. I feel like he could stand up on a podium and announce a plan to hang every last black person in the country and his supporters would just say "Hey, that's not racist! Everyone knows blacks are the biggest criminals! He's just tough on crime!"
