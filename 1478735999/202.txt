The problem is that people don't want their opinions changed. Most people make up their minds on issues very early on, generally based on the first piece of information they hear about it. Once their mind is made up they only listen to things that support that opinion and ignore or disbelieve anything to the contrary. Obviously not literally everyone does this, but far far too many do. So after a year of campaigning, both sides have heard the other sides argument and is not budging. So rather than take the time and effort to explain your position for the 100th time when you know it's just going to fall on deaf ears, people take the easy route and just start resorting to calling Trump supporters racist.
