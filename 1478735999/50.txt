Because clearly those women were going to vote Trump anyway because the only problem with the opposition was that she was an old lady that doesn't quite get technology. If people bought into her being corrupt, they're not going to feel better about choosing between two old creeps.

I dont think Bernie meant harm by the essay, but you have to convince older Americans that live in the rust belt why that essay isnt creepy.
