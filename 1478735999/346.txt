I'd vote for the person who said they wanted to make my life better.

But it won't happen. There's no real way to make these people's lives better. Wal-mart won't leave and restore the small businesses. The plastic factory won't move back to town. The hospital won't be rebuilt. Why? Because the town is 10% smaller, aging, the school is losing public funding because tax revenue is dropping, and there's nothing to do for fun except to drive 30 minutes to the casino.

What is ANYONE supposed to do for these towns and communities? You can't legislate factories. You can't force young people to stay somewhere they'll never have a good job. You can't make Google set up shop in Hutchinson, Kansas.

It's fine to pander to these folks, but nothing can be done and that's why no one cares. There's no solution to their problem. They have to move, learn to do something useful, and evolve to the new economy.
