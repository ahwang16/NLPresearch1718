Let's take a self-interested approach to this. Politicians seek to appease the populations that vote in the highest numbers. For example, if young people don't vote very much, politicians have less incentive to cater to their wants. 

I am young, so when other young people don't vote, it lessens the degree that politicians cater to me, which is bad for me. It is reasonable to criticize people who act in a way that hurts me, so it is reasonable to criticize people like me who don't vote.
