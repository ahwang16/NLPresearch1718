You misunderstand me, I think.

It's not possible to 100% decouple nature and nurture, as far as I know. My point however is that for any given field it is entirely arbitrary to assume a 50/50 mix would happen if somehow culture had no influence on people, since men and women are biologically DIFFERENT. This includes the brain, as well as the rest of the body.

I'm not saying that evolved differences were specifically FOR governance but governance requires a large mix of things (preference, ability...) that men and women will almost certainly differ in (even if only slightly - again hard to say how much) because our brains are different. To reiterate: our evolved differences are not FOR governance but governance will certainly be a byproduct of the evolved differences.
