Here's a couple maps comparing the results of this primary and general election:

The 4 outcomes numerically tallied:


* Hillary won primaries in 11 states that went on to vote for Hillary in the general election.
* Bernie won primaries in 9 states that went on to vote for Hillary in the general election.
* Hillary won primaries in 17 states that went on to vote for Trump in the general election.
* Bernie won primaries in 13 states that went on to vote for Trump in the general election.


Now let's compare the 2016 final result to Obama's 2012 performance:

* Of the states in the first category, Obama carried all of them in the 2012 general election, representing 177 electoral votes.
* Of the states in the second category, Obama carried all of them, representing 56 electoral votes.
* Of the states in the third category, Obama carried Florida (27), Pennsylvania (21), Ohio (20), and Iowa (7), representing 55 electoral votes.
* Of the states in the fourth category, Obama carried Michigan (17) and Wisconsin (10), representing 27 electoral votes.

Finally, Hillary won in the District of Columbia primary and the general election there as well.

How this can be interpreted is as follows:

* Hillary won 28 states in the primaries, and 17 of them went on to vote for Trump, or 60%.
* Bernie won 22 states in the primaries, and 13 of them went on to vote for Trump, or 59%.

In 29 states, Hillary performed better in the primary than in the general. In 21 states, she performed better in the general than the primary. I compared her vote percentage in the primary with the one in the general by simply subtracting the general number from the primary number. If the result was positive (meaning she did worse in the general), I shaded the state orange. If the result was negative (meaning she did better in the general), I shaded the state green. For example, Hillary got 18.37% in the Alaska primary, but 36.67% in the Alaska general election, meaning she did better among the general electorate of Alaska compared with the Democratic primary electorate. On the other hand, she received 77.84% in the Alabama primary, but 34.54% in the general election, meaning she did better among the Democratic primary electorate than the general electorate there.

The top 5 states where the difference between her primary result and general election result were the greatest:

1. Alabama, with a difference of 43.3 points.

2. Mississippi, with a difference of 38.84 points.

3. Louisiana, with a difference of 32.68 points.

4. Arkansas, with a difference of 32.63 points.

5. Hawaii, with a difference of -30.95 points.

(This is excluding Vermont, with a difference of -52.95 points. While she won this state with a landslide 66.5% in the general, Bernie Sanders won his home state in a blowout, where she only received 13.62% of the vote. However, this is obviously an outlier that doesn't fit with the other ones).

The state with the smallest differences are:

1. Nevada, with a difference of 0.26 points.

2. West Virginia, with a difference of 0.29 points.

3. Michigan, with a difference of 0.95 points.

4. New Mexico, with a difference of -1.45 points.

5. Connecticut, with a difference of -2.1 points.
