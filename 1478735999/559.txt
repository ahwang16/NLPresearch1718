>I haven't met any supporters that care about his wall or illegal immigrants...

There's a bias here. I'm in a blue state, so there simply aren't many Trump supporters around. I'm not claiming that they don't exist, but just that I haven't met any.

>While I disagree with him saying that you are supporting those views by supporting him, I do agree that you are making it worse by not engaging in the discourse, with close friends especially.

This one is hard to sit with. I'm more than happy to engage in civilized debates where feelings don't get hurt at the end. But some never Trump people take it real personal. I guess there wasn't much incentive. I'm always happy to share what I know or have learned, but the oppositions that I've had experience in have always been more interested in pushing their views down the throats of others. I will have a hard time accepting that I have fault in disengaging these conversations.

>what do you expect? How do you expect that to change?

I think all of American needs this answer. The grief of Hilary supporters was heavy today, and a united country is in our best interest.
