I definitely agree with you in regards to the CRM. But these protests are not targeting something specific.  In the Civil Rights Movement, what they were fighting against was both unconstitutional and targeted specific laws.  These election protests are not attacking a specific law that can be changed. They are attacking the election of the legally elected president. 

Perhaps if they protested against Trump's questionable actions or implemented policies in the future that would be more successful?
