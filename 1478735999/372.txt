There have been other nationwide surveys that display similar results as the South Carolina survey. But the only decent ones that I can find are for the primary election. So (to your earlier point) their results would be indicative of the Trump supporters who supported him during the primaries, which is not indicative of the Trump supporters who supported him during the general election. I could try to estimate the number of Trump supporters with bigoted views during the general election, by looking at the number of Trump/Cruz/Rubio, etc. supporters with bigoted views during the primaries (since most Cruz, Rubio, etc. supporters probably switched to Trump), but I don't feel like doing the math (and it would be impossible anyway). 

If you want a perfect poll that surveys a representative sample of national Trump supporters at the general election that explicitly asks "are you racist?", then I don't think you will find that data. The best we have to work with is polls such as what I posted earlier to see if we can find some trends. And I think the general trend of Trump attracting bigotry is obvious. To be clear, Republicans generally attract more bigots than Democrats. However, according to the best polls and surveys that we have, Trump attracts bigotry significantly more than other Republican candidates, and I think that this is all that people mean when they associate Trump supporters with racism, sexism, etc.

Also, your remarks on Ben Carson's favorability does not dispel any claim that a significant portion of Trump supporters are racist, since "significant" only means ~7%. You can certainly have 7% of a group being racist even if 64% are not.
