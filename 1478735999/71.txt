Hillary lost michigan in the GE by 12 thousand votes. Bernie won michigan in the primary by 17 thousand votes.

Hillary lost wisonsin by 27 thousand votes in the GE. Bernie won wisconsin by almost 140 thousand votes in the primary. 

I would look at the vote totals and not the percentages. Those two states plus pennsylvania gave trump the presidency. Clinton only lost these by 1 hundred thousand votes total in the general election. I don't think Its unreasonable that bernie's clearly larger appeal with working class voters would have done better in these states. Clinton lost these voters by 40% all bernie would have had to do was lose them by like 30% and he could have won. 

Futher I don't think Jill Stein gets  anywhere near a million votes if Bernie runs in the GE. She offered to step down and let him run in her place for crying out load. She may have had a small spoiler effect in this election, but who knows. 

Also I don't think gary johnson quadrupels his vote total from the previous election in year when voter turnout is down if Bernie runs. I think a lot of bernie supporters defected to johnson because they couldn't stomach either Clinton or Trump. I don't think He had a spoiler effect though because I imagine that voters from both sides canceled each other out. 

Trump got a few less votes than Romney, but HRC got much fewer votes than Obama. Obama got 5 million more than her in 2012 and he did by exciting the electorate. Hillary got really low turnout, It was like the democratic base plus people who were voting against trump. I don't think its unreasonable to assume that Bernie could captured what she has plus the voters he did excite.
