Yeah, good point. I just realized that in my title it implies my view is that there is literally zero importance. It'd be more accurate to say I don't find it "all that" important. As in, it's importance is much, much lower than the discussion about it in the media; Especially lately with the disappointment that we won't have our first female president in 2016.
