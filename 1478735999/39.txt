> I think we have a clear answer already as to whether past behavior means more to voters than policies. The man who is currently the president elect ran a scam for-profit school, screwed over legions of small businesses and contractors and copped to being a sexual assaulter on video.

You're probably mistaken to assume that just because Trump got a free pass on everything that Sanders would have as well. That's my gut feeling anyway. People were desensitized to Trump scandals through his constant spouting off and the ridiculous amount of media coverage (that too often got distracted by the scandalous comment of the day and ignored more substantive issues), and his personality gives him a strange sort of immunity because people can and do handwave his most bothersome comments as "just bravado", "he doesn't mean it", "there he goes mouthing off again" etc. There was a massive double standard surrounding Trump. Also, republicans are just more willing to fall in line, period.
