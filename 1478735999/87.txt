I think you're misreading my point.. you can get a sense of who would do better in the GE - Sanders or Clinton - based off of their open primary results. If Sanders beats Clinton by 10 pts in a state in the primary it's likely he would have done better than Clinton in that state in the GE -- but it's not a guarantee that he'd win.
