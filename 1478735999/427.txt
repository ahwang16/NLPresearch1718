CMV: I DON'T THINK ELECTING A FEMALE PRESIDENT IS IMPORTANT

Doesn't this have to assume that 100% of the population wants to be president though? I know that I certainly don't want to be president. 

I'm not convinced that since women are slightly more than 50% of the population, then half of our presidents should therefore be female.

Firstly, there have been far fewer women that have ran for president in the primaries. Since only a handful have actually run in the past, wouldn't that also explain the lack of female presidents?

I'll certainly agree that due to cultural norms/standards, fewer woman have a desire to be president in the first place. But this doesn't bother me as I feel that both genders are equally forced into roles as soon as they are born, it's just that each role is different, and neither is better or worse than the other.

I should make clear, I don't consider myself to be an egalitarian, I just think it's the most accurate label to apply if one must be applied (for contextual purposes).

Also, there are different forms of equality. These aren't the dictionary terms, but the two in question here is equality of opportunity, and equality of results.

My interest is in that of opportunity, in that I want every single person regardless of what type of human they are, to have equal opportunity. As such, legal rights are what is most meaningful to me.

Equality of results I don't find achievable in a practical sense. Trying to achieve this would basically be something like "there hasn't been a female president, and there should be, thus we should consider being female a positive in the candidates and being male a negative". The slippery slope here I think should be pretty obvious.
