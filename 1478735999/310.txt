I actually think the Clinton distortion is worse. Every time I've seen this used it's always "she called Trump supporters deplorables. Doesn't she realize many are good people who are struggling?" That's exactly what she said in a few sentences. Unless someone wants to deny that there are any Trump supporters who aren't awful racists, nothing she said was controversial.
