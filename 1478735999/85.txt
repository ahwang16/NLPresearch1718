Trump and Bernie both rode a populist wave during their primaries. The country is largely sick and tired of "establishment politics" and view the political insiders as people who aren't working for them. like they're working for wall st and big business. This is *especially* true for the white working class. In this environment the last thing either party should do is pick a Washington insider who appears to be cozy with Wall St. Trump ran a campaign as an outsider and had a lot of success. You rightfully point out that Bernie has 40 years experience, but his record shows that he has often bucked the political system. Like it or not, elections are more about feelings and emotion than facts and very few people view him as a political insider. More importantly, his message about political corruption, Wall St greed, and the need for real form resonated with the working class. He was the first one to be talking about these issues during the primary. It's also likely that all of the states that Clinton won Bernie would have also won. They are all solid Dem states with the exceptions of Virginia and NH. In NH Bernie CRUSHED Clinton... and this was a state she carried in 2008 vs Obama and that Bill Clinton carried in 1992.

You basically have to look at what states were "up for grabs", who won them, how much they won by and why. Clinton lost six states that Obama took in both 2008 & 2012. FL, OH, IA, PA, MI, & WI. You have to look at how the dem candidates performed in these states during the primary - this means we have to consider how the primary might reflect the general elections attitude. We can agree that open primaries are more similar to the general election because they allow non-registered democrats to have their voice heard, correct? Ok... so the states.

Florida has been a close state for both parties for a long time so this one is easy to excuse, and I think it's legitimate to excuse the lose. It's very possible that Bernie would have lost this state too. All of the rest fell for the exact same reason.. the white working class didn't turn out for Clinton.

All of the rest of the states are states that have a very solid white working class. This is the rust belt. This is the people who are pissed off at the establishment...

Wisconsin & Michigan - Bernie was the more popular Democrat in both of these states. He appealed to the white working class. His message resonated in the same way that Trumps did. These are traditional blue states .. no one considered these states to be play. MI last went red in 1988 and WI in 1984. Clinton lost these states because she was rebuked by the white working class. Bernie was appealing to these people... he was more popular than Clinton in the primary. She lost Michigan by 0.3% and WI by 1%. Bernie being the stronger performer in the primary and having a populist appeal would have won the day for the democrats in the General.

Pennsylvania -- this has been a Dem state since 1992 (24 years - 6 elections). Obama won it in 2012 by 5.2%. Clinton lost it by 1.2% - an insane swing of 6.4% from the previous election. This is the same story... it was the Dems state to lose with the white working class. 

Iowa & Ohio -- same story, but less in the automatic Dem column. 

**Minorities**

When it comes to the minority vote you have to look at where they are and which way that state would go. A big deal was made during the primary about how Clinton had the black/minority vote, but this only held true in the south. Sanders was very popular with latinos and blacks in NV and all minorities, especially Muslims, in the midwest. Clinton's dominance in the south was great for her in the primary, but it was useless in the general election.

States like SC, GA, AL, MS, TN, LA, & AR were never going to go to the dems. Obama couldn't carry them in 2008 or 2012 so there's no reason to think that a minority appeal would move them to the Dems for Clinton. Her minority appeal in the south was absolutely useless with one exception -- North Carolina. Obama took the state in 2008, but lost it in 2012. Again, Clinton's minority appeal was unlikely to win the state.


**Lack of Attacks**

This is an incorrect assessment. While Clinton didn't run strong negative ads against Bernie, her Super PACs did... the only reason anyone even mentions his Russian honeymoon or his 'rape fantasy' is because he was attacked on them through her surrogates. Bernie also went easy on Clinton during the primary. He had dozens of avenues to attack Clinton on, but he didn't. Let's also remember that Clinton has always been hated by the Republicans and had the 2nd lowest favorability ratings of any presidential candidate. She polls terribly at being trusted. Meanwhile, Bernie polls as america's most popular politician and scores exceedingly high in trustworthiness polls. This goes a long way in retaining and gaining support (just look how bad Clinton dropped when the FBI mentioned there were new emails to review -- her support was weak).

**Not appealing to Trump voters**

I'll first disagree that Bernie causes religious anxiety. His faith was never a factor during the primaries and discussed once (despite Clinton trying to make it an issue - see the DNC leaks on this). He did better than Clinton did with the Muslim population in the Midwest because his populist message was more important than his faith.

And you're right that he wouldn't have appealed to Trumps racist, xenophobic supporters... but they're only part of his support. Like I've repeated over and over, this was an election where people were SICK of establishment politics. He easily appealed to these people as was evident with his strong win in Wisconsin and his stunning upset in Michigan.

**The math**

If you put MI, WI, and PA back in into the Dem column, they win. These states were gimmes for the Dems and have all been carried since 1992. That's all Bernie had to do and his populist appeal would have easily retained them. Additionally, Sanders completely owned the 45 and under demographic on the dem side. These people were very motivated to come out and vote for him -- this is a group Clinton completely floundered with in the general. If anything, Bernie's appeal here would have made the states Clinton won even stronger wins. In the year of Trump Clinton received less votes than Obama did in 2012. She simply didn't motivate anyone to vote FOR her.

**TLDR**

Clinton failed to connect with the white working class who are sick of establishment politics. That was what this election was all about... not race or religion. Clinton lost traditional dem strongholds because she IS an establishment figure and her message didn't resonate. People weren't motivated to vote FOR her, only against Trump - a vote any Dem candidate would have had. Sanders connected with the white working class and inspired people to vote for him. 


**EDIT:**
I never even mentioned the polling of Clinton v Trump & Sanders v Trump that was done during and immediately after the primary. In ever poll Clinton was neck and neck with Trump - sometimes winning, sometimes losing. Bernie always was winning and with a healthy margin. While this is not a guarantee of any sorts it shows that Bernie was preferred more than Clinton in a matchup against Trump. A 10pt advantage over Clinton when compared to Trump lead in these polls doesn't mean he'd beat Trump by 10 more points, but it does show that he would most likely do better than Clinton did... and in a general election where Clinton lost states by thin margins it matters. PA - 1.2% loss, MI - 0.3%, WI - 1.0%, FL - 1.3% ..
