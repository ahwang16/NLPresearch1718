First of all, every left-wing activist I've known for years goes out of their way to avoid calling people "rednecks," because it's classist.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, just that that sort of thing is typically frowned on in the activist community.

Anyway... what do you suggest liberals do?  We care about living in a country where marginalized people feel safe and welcome... we think it's wrong when someone infringes on that, and Trump's language certainly did, in many ways.  Do you want us to not think that's wrong?  If it's ok that we think it's wrong, do you want us to not say out loud that it's wrong?  If we see someone excusing it or ignoring it, should we just not speak up about the thing we think is most important about the dude?

The thing that confuses me is that you say it caused you pain.  I certainly don't defend anyone calling anyone a redneck, but if someone thinks you're a racist for supporting Trump despite (or because of) what he says, does that really hurt you?  And if that pain causes you to vote for Trump to spite liberals... honestly, that sounds to me like something you'd do anyway.
