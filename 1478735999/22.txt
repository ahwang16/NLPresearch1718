CMV: THERE IS NO REAL EVIDENCE THAT BERNIE SANDERS WOULD HAVE EASILY BEATEN TRUMP, DESPITE THE FLOOD OF /R/ALL POSTS CLAIMING SO

We've all seen those polls where Bernie Sanders has better odds against Trump than HRC did. Well, there's a major issue with them (besides the polls just not necessarily being accurate, as was proven a few days ago). 

The majority of Americans knew and know little about Sanders other than that he is "anti-establishment" and opposed HRC during the primaries. Neither Hillary nor the Reps attacked him hard publicly, since Hillary wanted Sanders's support and the Republicans wanted Sanders to weaken Hillary's standing. That means that the average voter has heard a lot about Hillary and Trump's many faults but mainly positive things about Bernie. 

No wonder that, in this situation, Bernie would beat Trump in polls.

Add to that that only a third of Americans have a favorable view of socialism, that the GOP *does* have material they can use/twist against Sanders (like his supposed "rape essays," his support for Communist militants during the Cold War, etc) to fire up the Republican base and convince conservative independents, and that Bloomberg would most likely have run and taken away at least some of the left-leaning money and votes antagonized by Sanders's rhetoric, there really is not much evidence Sanders would have beaten Trump.

Additionally, let's look at the close states during this election (states won by less than 8%). Regardless of whether/how the primaries were rigged, it's still worth having a look. 

Close states (probably) won by Trump:

* Pennsylvania (4/26, closed primary): HRC wins by 12.1%
* Wisconsin (4/5, open primary): Sanders wins by 13.5%
* North Carolina (3/15, semi-closed primary): HRC wins by 13.6%
* Georgia (3/1, open primary): HRC wins by 43.1%
* Florida (3/15, closed primary): HRC wins by 31.1%
* Arizona (3/22, closed primary): HRC wins by 14.9%
* Michigan (3/8, open primary): Sanders wins by 1.4%

Close states (probably) won by Clinton:

* Nevada (2/20, closed caucus): HRC wins by 5.3%
* Colorado (3/1, closed caucus): Sanders wins by 18.7%
* Minnesota (3/1, open caucus): Sanders wins by 23.2%
* Virginia (3/1, open primary): HRC wins by 29.1%
* Maine (3/6, closed caucus): Sanders wins by 28.8%
* New Hampshire (2/9, semi-closed primary): Sanders wins by 22.4%

The red states of 2016 that Sanders could have won without much difficulty appear to be Michigan (0.3% for Trump) and Wisconsin (1% for Trump). But even without these two Midwest states and the one Maine vote, Trump has 279 electoral votes.

Furthermore, even without all the states Trump just barely won (by 2% or less), Trump has 259 votes already. All he needs is Pennsylvania *or* Michigan *or* Wisconsin (with Wisconsin he's 269, but the House would make him POTUS). And even if Sanders keeps all three, we need to factor in Bloomberg as well; what if he splits the vote enough to make a Trump victory somewhere like Virginia (where Trump lost by 4.9%) possible? 

**My point isn't that Sanders would have lost. It's that we have no real evidence to say that he would have won.** Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, etc.
