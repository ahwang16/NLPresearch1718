>  However, the fact of the matter is that Hillary Clinton had 47.66% of the popular vote, while Donald Trump had 47.50%, for a difference of 0.16 percentage points. Based on those numbers, it is impossible to say whether non-voters would have voted one way or the other, and it is therefore completely baseless to blame non-voters for the results.

I think you're misconstruing the argument being made there. Blaming non-voters for electoral outcomes generally happens between people who share political beliefs and/or demographic traits that correlate with political beliefs. So if I were to blame a non-voter for a Trump victory, the implication is that I either know or believe that person would have voted for Clinton.

The other point to take into consideration is that groups that show up in smaller numbers (young people, ethnic minorities) tend to vote Democrat, so it's not a toss-up in terms of what effect it would have if people in these groups brought their numbers in line with older white people.
