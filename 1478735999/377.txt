A straw man argument is a refutation of an original argument, distorting the original assertion so it's easy to refute. My argument is the original one and thus can't be a straw man.

> Stop and frisk.

There's nothing inherently racist about stop and frisk. I personally think it is perpetuates discriminatory practices, but I don't see this as evidence that Trump's voters do, or even that a significant number of them voted for him because of the policy.

> Halting all Muslim immigration and suggesting deporting all Muslims.

When did he suggest deporting all Muslims? He suggested a *temporary ban* on Muslims, in order to tighten security at the borders and make sure radical terrorists weren't getting into the country. But that in and of itself is not xenophobic.
