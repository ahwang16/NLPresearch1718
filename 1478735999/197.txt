> Has something happened where you now have to fear for your life because of me?

Not of you, necessarily. Minority groups are afraid of two things right now:

1. **Republican goals and policies leading to our disenfranchisement**. Women (and anyone who gets care through PP) are afraid of loss of funding for PP. Immigrants are afraid of deportation. Trans people are afraid that if the ACA gets repealed, we'll no longer be able to get healthcare because before the ACA we were a preexisting condition.

2. **A rise in violence against minorities**, similar to what was seen after Brexit. Yes, some Trump supporters are not actively bigoted, but some are, and to those people, Trump's message was empowering. Now his election is even more empowering, and I've already seen plenty of (informal) reports of increased violence or harassment.

Obviously, I can't speak for everyone, but I don't fear Trump supporters because they voted for him. I fear them because I don't know, and have no way of telling, *why* they voted for him.
