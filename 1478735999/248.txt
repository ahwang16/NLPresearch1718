> But it didn't have anything to do with the case, like that would make it sound. Trump explicitly said that he shouldn't be able to judge a Trump case because of Trump's political stances. Maybe there'd be a hint of reason to it if the guy was an immigrant and there was a conflict because Trump is anti-immigrant, but it was simply because the guy was Hispanic.

I don't want to get into an argument on whether or not this was racist, but it is ambiguous at the very least - an argument can be made either way. It is not solid proof of him being racist.

>do you really think they wouldn't have voted for Trump if Trump said what he wanted and the Democrats didn't criticize him?

I can't speak for everyone, but I would have been more inclined to vote Clinton if this happened. If you show me a rude, impolite man next to a incredibly civil, polite woman, I will be more inclined to vote Clinton. 

However, if her and her supporters are rude and condescending, it will go the other way.


> It wasn't sufficient to stop Trump this time around, by a slim margin, but that doesn't mean it was counterproductive.

I think the problem here is many of his supporters (like myself) are actually not racist. Shaming does not make us repent and give up, it galvanizes us instead.
