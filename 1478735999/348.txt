You are willfully ignoring half of the narrative surrounding this election (and politics in general) if you think that liberals are the only ones being cruel, condescending, and elitist.  

Donald trump and his cronies mocked the differently abled, called an entire nationality rapists and murderers, and discounted the experiences and worth of an entire gender. The way Donald talked to Hillary was endlessly condescending ("nasty woman," comments about her looks, etc), and he was equally condescending to others (can you answer a question about African Americans without talking about inner cities? no?).  Liberals are disparaged just as much as conservatives; we have long been painted as communists, crazy hippies, homos, trouble-makers, welfare queens, lazy, etc.  

As for elite, one of the candidates lives in a skyscraper with his name on it, and one does not.
