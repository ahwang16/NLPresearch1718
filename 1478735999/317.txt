I'm amused by all those posts insisting it's 'liberals' who brought Trump's victory by triggering his supporters. Trump's almost entire campaign was built on spewing hate. People, virtually everyone apart from white males, were constantly attacked. And now, after it turned out that at least half of America is fine with that, it turns out it's the fault of the other half for triggering them... Seems like victim-blaming to me.

That's ridiculous. If someone's line of thinking is "hey, that person is cozy with the KKK, but the other side is calling him racist and that's not cool at all, so I'll vote for him anyway", this person was never going to vote against Trump. Saying it's a result of calling it out or smugness is simply looking for a way to blame it on the other side, while in reality it was Trump who started the division and people picked their side. It simply turned out there's many more voters who were fine with racism/sexism/jingoism than anyone imagined they would be. (And, of course, Clinton being a deplorable candidate who could not motivate her potential voters, but that does not change the dynamics with Trump voters.)

There was never a way for the DNC to win them over during the election. They could and should have worked on it with actual policies over the decades. But this election was lost the moment an openly bigoted person joined because that's who most of America wants.
