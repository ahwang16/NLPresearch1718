I was discussing this with a friend yesterday. I pointed out to her that likely many Trump supporters weren't racist or sexist (in an overt way at least) but they probably just didn't care that Trump was. She responded that apathy is just as bad. So while people may understamd that you and other Trump supporters are not bigots they think that accepting a bigot is just as bad.
