I know, as does most everyone else, that republicans didn't vote just cuz racism and homophobia. Donald trump supports gay rights anyway.  

You voted for a clearly racist xenophobe, though. The fact that this doesn't offend you is why Donald trump's support comes entirely from white people. You aren't offended because it's not your tribe. 

You are offended by the perceived insinuation of liberals that we think we are better than you, but not on behalf of decorum, decency, or family values (grab em by the pussy anyone?) enough to make you think twice about electing someone as an "f you" to people who you perceive as condescending?

What's more - for four years and with more power than anyone else in this country?? To flip the bird?

Honestly when this started, I considered that. I'm that dissatisfied as well, to just secretly hope someone will light it afire so we can rebuild something modern and reasonable. 

But we are giving up on climate change here. Not enough people are talking about that. We are going full bore into fossil fuels to bring back jobs that won't last, rather than re educating those folks. Do you think Europe is going to stick with the Paris agreement now that the two largest emitters are plugging their ears and destroying the future in the name of short term prosperity?
