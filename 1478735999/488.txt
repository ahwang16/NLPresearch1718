I really like this, I hadn't thought of this at all, but I have two compounding issues here: 

If you own land, how far down do your property rights extend up or down, and by what mechanism can we objectively determine this?

Even with a clearly defined region of owned space above or below your property, how can you claim ownership of the air within that space? It's a fluid, and the particles within your section of space exchange themselves with particles in other zones of space
