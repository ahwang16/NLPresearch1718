I'm also in a blue state, and I should add the caveat that I'm a libertarian who voted for Johnson so the stuff I hear is usually directed at other people.

I hear that women only vote for Hillary because she's a woman and a lot of joking about repealing women's suffrage. I hear about how liberals are thought police and traitors to real Americans and how they're either self-hating or "the real racists" who hate white people.
