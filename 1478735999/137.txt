The divisiveness strategy was ultimately *unsuccessful* in this election, but that doesn't mean it was counterproductive.  

It's only counterproductive if it results in a net loss in votes.  Sure, their tactics pissed off some moderates, but they did manage to fire up their base.  You have to ask yourself, if the Democrats didn't use those divisive tactics, how much of their base constituency would show up for elections?  It's likely they would've had less turnout, possibly more than offsetting the Trump supporters who were motivated by the hate.

And make no mistake, it's a deliberate strategy.  See the leaked Podesta memos and emails.  The theory is that as the demographic profile of the U.S. shifts, Democrats will be increasingly successful if they can keep blacks, latinos, and LGBT locked down.  It didn't pan out for them this time, but how else are you supposed to maximize turnout if you rely on marginalized groups as your base?
