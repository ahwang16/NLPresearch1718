I know it's not. You know it's not. 

But you and I both forget that large swaths of America are predominantly white. Within these predominantly white swaths of America are heavily impoverished completely white towns. When people who are born in poverty, who attend shit schools the are statistically unlikely to graduate from, who come into adulthood into a community that lacks jobs for them, are told that they have some kind of "privilege" simply because they're white they're going to perceive it as an accusation.  

What they hear when we use that term is that even though they have lasting health issues from childhood malnutrition, even though they were unable to finish high school because they needed to get a job at the local widget factory to help out the family after dad got hurt at work, even though they now are out of work with a ninth grade education and a completely useless skill set since the widget factory and subsequently everything else in town closed up shop fifteen years ago, they are still in a better position than black people who, because of their "white privilege," they should feel obligated to help. 

You and I know that's not what white privilege means. But you and I and all our fellow liberals need to take a moment and realize that for America's white poor, that's what white privilege sounds like. That on top of all the other shit wrong in their lives they should also feel bad about simply being white. That to make up for the crime of being white they should vote for politicians and policies that help black people even though no one bothers to tell them how those politicians and policies will help them.
