The idea behind voting third party isn't out of any expectation that your candidate will win. It's to show you exist as a voter base that matters and isn't satisfied with the current options. When third parties gain traction, major parties take notice and adjust their policies. Consider that Gary Johnson got 4 million votes this election cycle. That's 4 million people who could decide a future election for any candidate who earned their vote.
