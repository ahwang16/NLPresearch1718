Well if there's no variation it's because you're not moving through the ranks. The meta changes as you climb. Early ranks people play decks with fast matchups. Higher up control becomes more prevalent. If you look at the top decks at legend level, none of them are the two decks you're complaining about. 

Try reading a guide for a deck that looks good and has a good matchup against zoo and aggro shaman, and play test it for a while. 

If you don't want to do that, that doesn't make Hearthstone a bad game. It makes you a bad player.
