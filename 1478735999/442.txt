> Of course you wouldn't think that, because presidents have only ever been male

True - However, I don't feel particularly liberated by the slight rise in male homemakers (traditionally female practice obviously). Like I don't feel positive or negative towards the fact that it's a little more acceptable socially for me to be a homemaker if I choose to be than it was previously.

> Generally when people talk about the importance of electing a female president they are not suggesting that gender should override all other considerations

Good point. Important yes, but not literally the most important thing.

So is what you're saying that, yes it's true that a lack of many women choosing to run for president is the cause of there being no female presidents, and one solution to that problem is having a female president? IE - Women would see a female president, and possibly be inspired to run for president themselves?
