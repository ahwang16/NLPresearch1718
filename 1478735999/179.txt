Sure, and I think it is fine to attack other candidates. However, from what I remember, in 2008 it was more along the lines of "Republicans did Iraq" , "McCain is just Bush's third term" and "conservatives ruined the economy".

All things that conservatives or moderates can potentially relate to, and nothing that is condescending and rude to piss people off.
