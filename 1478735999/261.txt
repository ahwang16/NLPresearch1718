I think a big roadblock is the word "privilege." This reminds me so much of how people can't wrap their heads around imaginary numbers asking, "why do we care about numbers that aren't real?" even though there's nothing imaginary about imaginary numbers. We could just call them "retro numbers" or "italic numbers" or "fat numbers" or any other word, but we chose to keep "imaginary" and the colloquial definition of "imaginary," which has the connotation of "something of little importance," is a stumbling block to algebra students to this day.
