What it will take or me is a couple of things or a combination 

1. He proposes actually racist things.  

I think stop and frisk laws should be reinstated with greater protections for citizens written in and harsh punishment for officers who break that law. I don't think a wall is racist.

2. He actually tries to deport illegal immigrants. 

3. He appoints Justices that want to overturn gay marriage. I am fine with judges that are more Libertarian that limit what the federal government does and gives more power back to states. 

4. He repeals Obamacare but doesn't replace it. 

I did not vote for him. I recognized his flaws from the outset. I didn't vote for Clinton because she didn't earn my vote either. 

It isn't like I look at Trump like a Savior descending from the Heavens to save the nation. But it isn't like I see the devil climbing up from the dark abyss of hell either. I think we'll be the same, or better off, in four years. People forget he is one of the most liberal Republicans to ever run, he just tapped into the global nationalism movement at the right time while Hillary sunk her own ship.
