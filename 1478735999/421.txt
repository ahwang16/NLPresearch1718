Isn't the reason just that very few women have chosen to run for president? I can only think of 5, there may be more but I don't think that many more.

I don't mean to sound insulting, but I think often people just automatically jump to a default position that sexism must be the cause of a gender gap until proven otherwise. I find it similar to how some religious people will attribute god/miracle to something they can't explain until it is objectively explained.

I completely agree that there are people who state in forums that we aren't ready for a woman president. In fact I've seen much worse than that, where the person honestly believes that a woman is inherently less capable of being president than a man is. However, I've also seen militant feminists seriously propose that men who commit any violent crime (not limited to rape) be castrated in order to eliminate their biological propensity towards violence. I think internet forums are just a wash, and that you'll find people with extreme views from the right all the way to the left and off the scale.
