Define "significant" in terms of a percentage. There are polls that show that some percentage of Trump supporter endorse the views you have indicated, a percentage that many might find significant (and which are certainly *relatively* significant). In an effort to avoid presenting some such polls only for you to potentially denounce the percentages as insignificant, we should settle upfront what sort of percentages you have in mind when you say "significant".

EDIT: By the way, when people assert that a "significant" number of Trump supporters endorse these views, they probably do not mean the majority of Trump supporters. And therefore such assertions are perfectly compatible with the idea that most Trump supporters are working class people who think Trump's policies will benefit them more than Clinton's.
