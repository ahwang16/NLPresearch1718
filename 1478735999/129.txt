Obviously I am using the word "liberal" in the context of US politics. I mean left leaning people and democrats. Please do not argue against me by saying "technically republicans are liberals too" or something like that. 

This election, I have seen so much condescension and shaming coming from liberals that it disturbed me. People say you are a racist just for voting for Trump. Hillary called Trump supporters "deplorable". People on my facebook (and other peoples facebook from what I have heard) say they will unfriend you if you speak favorably of Trump. Trump and his supporters are smugly mocked by people like John Oliver. Trump supporters are called stupid, white trash, rednecks. If they are minorities, they are called self-hating fools. If I try to say I support Trump in college, I get a dozen angry Sanders supporters attacking me. If you complain about the economy, you are just a redneck who is angry that minorities have equal rights.

No one ever acknowledges that people might have a legitimate reason to vote for Trump, or that we might not be racist for doing do.

I understand this might be entertaining to liberals, but it also hurts their position. Me and other voters I know were partially motivated by revenge.

We just wanted to lash out at liberals, at all their smugness and elitism. Maybe Trump will not fix everything, but he can at least piss the liberals off. Make them feel some of the pain they make us feel.

This is not a very good reason to vote for a candidate, but it is a reason. I believe that me and many other people were motivated to vote for Trump as revenge for liberals being so cruel and condescending. I believe this is counterproductive for democrats, and if they care about winning they should not do this.
