I see more a situation where the Democrats were about keeping things the along the same path (while homing some liberal fringe loudmouths for flavor but what else is new) while Trump pretty luckily or dare I admit it masterfully became the voice of making progress on real economic issues affecting large numbers of voters (while homing the usual republican party fringes for flavor) in an election year that favored revolution. His insistence on revolutionary change hit the right note despite the fact people hated much of what he was associated with even worse than what Clinton was associated with. I know that I (usually quiet moderate) for one have been really disturbed by how closely related our top leaders have been (Bush and Clinton clans) and have been hoping for fresh contenders... I wouldn't really have really picked Trump but he could more legitimately claim to be an agent of change and Hillary (bless her anyway) was inevitably looking stale as old cheese. Comfortable and possibly well aged, but cheese nonetheless. Liberal blowhards and political desperados were an unuseful distraction but didn't really enter into it. More than anything I think they fooled themselves and allied voters into thinking they were clear winners and owners of the most important issues rather than changing anyone's mind one way or the other. They didn't help Trump, any more than the Republican fringes helped Clinton by chasing off more moderate Trumpers. It was the need in the rust belt for revolution (socio-economic, not social justice/vengeance) even among their moderate less drama focused voters made it happen and the Dems (and most of us honestly) were caught pants down focusing primarily on scandal and entertainment style news when voters were really caring more about other things.
