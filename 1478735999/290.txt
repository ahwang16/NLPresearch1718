Except Clinton won the popular vote. 

More importantly I'm not sure what you expect people to do. We tried calmly explaining the problems and trying to have an open dialogue, but Trump supporters refused to listen or engage. Trump supporters refused to look at or acknowledge facts. We tried to loudly explain and point to the racism and why it's bad, and you said we were being condescending. 

So how exactly do liberals get across to Trump supporters the very rational reason why minorities, lgbt individuals, etc. Are fucking terrified right now in a way that you'll actually listen to?
