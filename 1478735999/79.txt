I tend to agree with you actually because the key thing people miss is that what Trump would latch onto with Sanders instead of "emails", is that he's a socialist which would establish the same kind of rhetoric. He would likely start by immediately calling him a communist, and socialism/communism is the ultimate sin from the right's perspective.
