The main reason that your country is fucked is because half the population votes on a good year.

When huge groups of people dont vote, they dont get represetned in govt.

Young people, minorities, the poor, all get fucked by politicians the worst and thats because **they vote in the smallest numbers**. Then they turn around and complain that all the legislation works against them. The politicians serve the interests of rich, white people over 30 because they vote in the largest numbers.

It is everyones duty to vote in order to ensure a healthy democracy. We all suffer because of the people who dont vote.
