Some books can teach you about life or open your eyes to different ways of doing things. This is extremely true with non-fiction but this is also the case for many fictional works. You are certainly entitled to find that some classics no longer offer any lessons but it's hard to really assume that fiction in general is useless in this regard unless you've "been around the block" a little bit. I personally love Asimov for the themes he talks about in his works. In fact, fiction has the advantage over non-fiction that it can result in catharsis towards events in your life.   

In a way, there is nothing that is particularly meaningful over a long enough period of time.
