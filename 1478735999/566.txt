Or stupid.  
There is a good video of the daily show, i think, on YouTube, where the reporter goes to a female trump supporter who thinks Hilary would be bad because women can't be president.  
Systematic sexism is so deeply rooted that women can easily be conditioned to feel negatively about themselves or other women. Easily.
