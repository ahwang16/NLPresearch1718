>I would say this is a valid reason, as it is a conflict of interest.

But it didn't have anything to do with the case, like that would make it sound. Trump explicitly said that he shouldn't be able to judge a Trump case because of Trump's political stances. Maybe there'd be a hint of reason to it if the guy was an immigrant and there was a conflict because Trump is anti-immigrant, but it was simply because the guy was Hispanic. Trump's request implies either that Trump knew he's racist, or that he thinks that a qualified judge can't tell what racism is if they're a minority.

Do you not see what an absolutely horrifying precedent it would set for Trump's argument to be taken seriously?  You think it would be a good thing for your justice system to reward bigots by letting them only get white judges? For minority judges to have cases taken away from them whenever a bigot requested it?

>I think it is fair to say it really annoyed many people and got them to vote Trump. 

It's fair to say it didn't stop a ton of people voting for Trump, sure, but do you really think they wouldn't have voted for Trump if Trump said what he wanted and the Democrats didn't criticize him?

>Shaming might be effective at silencing Trump supporters and discouraging them from publicly stating support, but it won't stop them from voting.

Sure, but when people don't feel they can publicly state support for an idea that idea tends to suffer as a consequence. That's how it's worked for pretty much every idea pretty much everywhere, a brief period of success for unusually explicit racism in America isn't a big enough shock to make us question that principle. It wasn't sufficient to stop Trump this time around, by a slim margin, but that doesn't mean it was counterproductive.
