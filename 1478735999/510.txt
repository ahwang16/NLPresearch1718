> They are making movies. 

This, and not only that, **China is buying out the rights to produce movies based on western books**. I was obsessed with the Warriors series when I was a kid, and I certainly didn't expect Alibaba (whose owner is a member of the Chinese Communist Party) to buy the rights to film it.

I guess the US has power via soft power. It uses films like Captain America and Hunger Games to propagate the idea that freedom and human rights are important and that we should fight against corrupted governments. People from around the world watch these films and respond to them. You have people from Hong Kong doing the Hunger Game's three finger salute during Occupy Central. Maybe Alibaba's move to start buying the rights to film western books is a way of China manipulating their plots to make them more pro-China.
