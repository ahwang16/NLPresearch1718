> I'm actually interested in your thoughts on that - do you consider it important that we elected our first black president a few years ago?

Absolutely. But keep in mind, I don't recall Obama ever once bringing up his ethnicity as a reason why people should vote for him. Clinton literally did, multiple times. Obama was a person running for president that happened to be half black; Clinton was a person who was a woman first, and a presidential candidate second.

> so I'm not sure what facts you are referring to

The fact that women have more *legal* rights than men do. The only legal right men have that women do not is the right to combat roles in the military so that they can die in combat.

> why isn't feeling bad enough

I honestly don't place much value in my, or other's, feelings in this context. Many Trump supporters voted for Trump because it felt good. The feeling will be temporary, and eventually go away. Feelings are fleeting.

> it means something to other people who happen to be female

Why though? When a male was elected as president, I wasn't thinking "yeah a victory for men! As a guy I'm happy another guy is president!" If you don't idenfity as a female, why does the gender of the president matter to you? What's the connection? It seems like we agree that in every objective/legal way, the president's policies are more important than their gender.

Let me put this another way, would you rather have a male president who wants to protect a woman's (legal) right to choose? Or a female president that wants to roll back Roe v Wade? (Don't know their precise stances, but both Palin and Fiorina want to reduce a woman's abortion rights in some way).
