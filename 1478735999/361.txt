Exactly.
This defines YOU, not me.
I voted for Senator Sanders, who wanted to unite the country.
You and Trump seek only to divide us, and you won't take credit for your OWN failure of character.  Own it.
You seek vengeance, and you seek to punish ALL of us, not just "liberals".
When the economy crashes again, I am going to repost your original post, and blame YOU, because this is entirely YOUR fault, NOT mine.
