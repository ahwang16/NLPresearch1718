> I'm gonna use a godwin's law but what would you call a supporter of Hitler? Fucking awful. 

I would consider them racist, since Hitler was actually racist, not just opposed to immigration.

However, if I was in a German election trying to convince people not to vote for Hitler, I would not call them that. I would instead tell them that racist policies are bad for Germany, that Hitler is not the right choice to advocate for them. I would try to convince them rather than insulting and demeaning them.
