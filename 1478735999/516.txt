Seeing people lose jobs and friends was just too much for me to risk over winning an inconsequential argument. I thought we were in a country where one of the founding principles was that you would not be persecuted for political views. Oh how the times have changed. Today's technology makes it easy to make anyone look bad. A lifetime of mistakes can be squeezed into a 30 second clip to make even Gandhi look like Hitler. It's very hard to change people's first impression, especially if they've already developed a very strong opinion. While I was very interested in learning about Bernie and Hilary, watching many of their speeches (not just clips of their worst moments), I found that most Trump haters had no interest in learning anything about Trump.
