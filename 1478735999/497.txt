I think that's safe.

I appreciate your semantic argument about my usage of the word *libertarian*.

Please give me another word that means *persons who fundamentally oppose taxation*.

Please also accept that I'm avoiding using a capital L because I'm referring to a particular kind of thought, not an established group of people.
