Exactly this. Voting for a third party simultaneously communicates several things:

1. I will vote
2. My vote does not belong to either party
3. This is how your party can change to get my vote

I see voting third party as a way of not voting for either party when they don't represent my interests and simultaneously showing them what my worldview is and that I am worth courting.
