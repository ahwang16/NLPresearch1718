Agreed on this, sort of. But I still don't see how it's something that could be solved in one election cycle - even if it's in the hands of the DNC to solve it in the first place. With how mass media and social networks function, I don't see a way for this to change since it'd be up to the highest bidder, and the highest bidders benefit from such divisions.
