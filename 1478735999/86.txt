> You have to look at how the dem candidates performed in these states during the primary - this means we have to consider how the primary might reflect the general elections attitude. 

This has been debunked many times. Primaries don't have an influence on GE. E.g. Trump won NH and Nevada but lost both of them in the GE. Hillary lost NH but won it in GE. Trump also lost Ohio and Wisconsin in the primaries but won it in the GE.
