Okay, but let's say i integrate the percentage of black people in the USA from it's foundation to the present day and divide that number by the number of years the USA exists, i'm pretty sure that percentage will still be higher than 2.2% (the percentage of black presidents)

My argument still stand, except you want to doubt that the average black percentage is higher than 2.2%, in which case i'll have to actually do the math.
