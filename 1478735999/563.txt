Let's pretend we have a weekly poker game. 

Sometimes we play with new people and sometimes we play with old people. 

Let's say we both knew a guy who happened to like to say racist jokes. Or someone who liked to say sexist comments about women. 

And let's say that the next poker game I invited that guy to sit down at the table. 

Once I invite that guy to the game I am suggesting that racist and sexist thoughts are okay. 

And that's how a lot of up are seeing Trump and the people that support him. 

He has said things that members of his own party have called fundamentally racist.  He has said comments that make it sound like he thinks he can use his position of power to sexually assault women he finds attractive. He is facing civil charges that he defrauded millions of dollars from middle class Americans. 

But he still was invited to the table. He is at the head of the table. 

People are challenging Trump voters because they saw sexist and racist comments made and no one seemed to care. They saw a man who has a history of stiffing small business owners and no one seemed to care. 

All of that was okay. 

And people have the right to ask you the question of it you saw all those things that other people saw and still voted for him .....why?
