I voted for Clinton, but it really bothered me how she'd borrow Michelle Obama's "when they go low, we go high" line, but still go for the low blows anyway. She didn't come out looking too good wrestling in the mud with Trump, and I think she would have benefited if she delegated the mudslinging to her surrogates and the media.
