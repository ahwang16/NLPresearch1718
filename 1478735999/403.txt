What I said was:

> A female president would prove that those barriers have broken down, and show that women in this country really can do anything; a female president would serve as a role model for young girls who feel disheartened about living in a "man's world" due to this enormous statistical discrepancy.

Whether it's a man's world or not, I am very clearly referring to young girls who FEEL that it is, which they certainly do, and not for no reason, since it is true that white men dominate elected offices. This is also why I put "man's world" in quotes, to place it in the realm of belief rather than a necessary truth.
