>No one, and I mean NO ONE, gives a fuck about them or their problems. 

This doesn't seem even a little bit out of touch to you? I'd venture to say that the 40% of the population that doesn't live in urban areas does, in fact, care about the struggles of rural America. 

Let's say that you are one of the people who you grew up with and never left the small town. You have one candidate who clearly only cares about pandering to the "elites" and the interests of Wall Street, sharing your viewpoint of "I don't give a fuck about your problems." Then you have another candidate who campaigns specifically towards telling you that they care about your problems, and that they want to make your life better. Who would you vote for?
