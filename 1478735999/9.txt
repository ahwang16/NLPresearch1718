No you're right. You did say those things already and I was being unresponsive. This is why I shouldn't be on reddit at work. 

Well, I usually don't feel down about the meta. I play intermittently -- some seasons climbing the ladder all the way, some not at all -- so maybe that changes my experience. To me it feels like expansions come out pretty regularly and have a big effect on the meta, especially since standard and wild formats emerged. 

I'm not trying to convince you of anything though, especially since I'm not sure I see where you're coming from.
