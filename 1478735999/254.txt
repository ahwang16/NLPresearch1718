>good friends of mine to have anxiety attacks because it makes them feel so unsafe

The fact that you think your friends' mental health issues and over sensitivity is somehow a valid point pretty much proves OP's point. I'm certainly not a Trump supporter, but thus kind of emotional overreaction is the exact kind of meaningless SJW bullshit people are fed up enough about to elect Trump.
