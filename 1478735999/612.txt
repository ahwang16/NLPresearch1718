So vote for a third party. Then at least you are showing the major candidates that there is support for ideologies outside of their platforms. The less votes they see outside of their party, the less the feel it necessary to change their platform. By not voting, you are helping to perpetuate the system, not fix it.

Unless you are going to go overthrow the government and fix it directly, voting reform can only come from voting in the current system. Not-voting won't change anything. Complaining when you didn't vote is abhorrent.
