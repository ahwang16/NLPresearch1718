Ohhh ok..

It's a global economy. Currently, the highest polluters are China and India. We, as a world, are trying to complete treaties to prevent a worldwide environmental disaster. The issue is, China and India are currently not in a position to slow their economic growth for the sake of the worldwide environment. Therefore, you'll find they and countries that are growing like them, are exempt from several things that would protect the environment. Other countries are willing to sacrifice their own environments for the  possible benefit of other countrie's economy. Countries struggle to prevent other countries, smaller or larger, from polluting. 

Citizens of a country will find this struggle real. Citizens will struggle to fight business's that want to pollute or destroy environment, as they have historically. Without a united front as seen with government intervention, the minorities that are directly affected from the pollution will most likely loose all they have. They'll of course try, but diffucult, expensive battles lie ahead. Large cities like New York City will probably be cleaner than ever,  but the large amount of land in the "fly over states" may be lost, as well as the agriculture.

This is why the government needs to step in and why we have to pay taxes to this cause. If they don't step in, the minority population and most of Americas land may be lost. If you look historically at countries,  this happens (chernobyl). The longer we keep our country usable, the more profit it'll bring us. This is a tax that needs to be paid, citizens step in all the time but it's not enough to battle the companies making money off of polluting.
