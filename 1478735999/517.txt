This might just be a personal pet peeve of mine, but let's not conflate social consequences of alienating other people with persecution. The same freedom that allows you to think and say what you want allows others to think and say what they want in turn.

Also, for a topic specifically about being unfairly stereotyped, you must realize that you're extrapolating from personal anecdotes. Your experiences with Trump opponents sound exactly like mine with his supporters.
