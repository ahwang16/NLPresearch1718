You are acting like the whole socialist thing would have been a detail but economics is a very high priority for voters and most people actually though Trump had high competence in the regard. Bernie was terrible on economics, his "break up the banks" plan was ridiculous and even worse than "build a wall". Also Bernie is part of the establishment as he always worked in politics and never even had a real job (as far as I know). Do you really think Trump would have let him get away with this?

Emails are a far minor issue than being a socialist that never worked in a normal job.
