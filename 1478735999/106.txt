True; what makes books worthwhile is not unique to books. Stories were oral traditions long before things were written down. But I think it would be a bit crazy to therefore discard books - a bit like saying, "Well, chicken fills all my nutritional needs, why eat anything else?" Because the richness of the eating experience transcends (and includes) chicken. And up until very recently, writing has been **the** way ideas are communicated, so you're losing a lot more than you gain.
