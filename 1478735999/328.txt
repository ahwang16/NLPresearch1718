I don't mean to be rude, but you must realize on some level that your own argument here is an example of precisely the cruelty and condescension you're trying to condemn. The same liberals you want to lecture on treating others better are going to feel like you put a knife in their back for the next four years. Spite voting to hurt people on the other side is something you need to own up to and realize isn't okay if you want to start a dialogue on compassion. Otherwise, by your own reasoning, you deserve someone in 2020 who makes Bernie Sanders look moderate as revenge for your act of spite.
