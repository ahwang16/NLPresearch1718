> I don't think the people who don't want to acknowledge privilege has existed will EVER vote for a major Democratic candidate, and I think if Democrats stop speaking up for social justice, they will lose their base.

We can stand up for social justice without being so antagonistic about it. Championing the rights and opportunity for marginalized people doesn't have to happen by crushing those who marginalize them into the dirt. It can happen by treating those people with respect, talking to them to learn why they feel this way, and showing them why it's wrong so they change their minds.
