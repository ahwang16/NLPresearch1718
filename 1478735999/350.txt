>We just wanted to lash out at liberals, at all their smugness and elitism. Maybe Trump will not fix everything, but he can at least piss the liberals off. Make them feel some of the pain they make us feel.

This is such a disturbingly irresponsible position. You talk about "legitimate reasons to vote for Trump" yet you don't give us any. You talk about liberals accusing you of this and that, yet you offer no defense. The classic Trump stance: "I swear I'm not racist...but here's some racist bullshit." You really think liberals were just throwing around insults for NO reason?
