I know your view has already been changed OP, but I'd still like to throw this in- while not all Trump voters are bigots, all the bigots voted for Trump, that's the issue. He had the support and endorsements of KKK leadership, white supremacists, and evangelical fundamentalists. People who demonised and condemned Hillary and Bernie both. 

There are plenty of people who for whatever other reason felt Trump was the best choice. Maybe they honestly think he's going to have the best economic impact. Maybe they think he's got a good diplomatic personality. I know a lot of the fringe independents who just want to see the system reformed jumped ship from the DNC after Bernie lost and voted Trump simply because they saw him as a wrecking ball. Not everyone who voted Trump was a bigot. But all the bigots voted Trump.
