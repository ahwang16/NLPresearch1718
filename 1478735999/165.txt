People are biased and people lie.  The anti-Clinton lies were in full force the last year.  To the point where they were amazingly ridiculous, yet people still chose to believe them.  The military is also very conservative.  So, given the choice between believing some people who have never liked or respected her or believing a Senate hearing full of Republicans that would love to put her away, I'll choose to believe the Senate hearing because it is WAY more credible than that Facebook meme that says "Killary is evil".  And that Senate hearing said she may have not made the best decisions in hindsight, but she did not doing anything wrong.
