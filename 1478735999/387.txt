> I believe that the vast majority of Trump supporters voted for him because they are working class and tired of feeling cheated by their government.

But this doesn't hold up to scrutiny.  Trump's been famous for being rich and extravagant for decades.  It's completely nonsensical to think he, of all people, would be a champion of the working class.

So, when things don't hold up to scrutiny, you look for other explanations.  His xenophobic rhetoric is very salient.
