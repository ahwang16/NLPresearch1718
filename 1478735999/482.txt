I'm saying the ship is going down. 

Regardless of your political beliefs...it is going down. Even if you don't think that the science is true or you think it is a Chinese hoax the damm ship is still going down. 

You're saying the best idea is to find those people who really care about the ship and bill them. 

I'm saying crew that. We are all on the ship. The ship going down means that we are all affected. It hits every single one of us. 

Let's all pay for it. 

The biggest problem is that there are people who are benefits from burning fossil fuels or those who are ignorant of the science or those  who simply don't care. 

But the ship is going down. This isn't time for half..pay in if you really want to...measures. 

This is time to save the ship  or sink with everyone.
