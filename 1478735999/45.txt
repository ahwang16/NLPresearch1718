I'm not going to try and define sexual assault. If people don't have a problem with a presidential candidate saying ...
>You can do anything. Grab â€™em by the pussy. You can do anything

... then people will not have a problem with this
>A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused

The second quote would not have decided the election just as the first one did not.
