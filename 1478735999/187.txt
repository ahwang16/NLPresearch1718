I would not compare **emotional** abuse to physical abuse, no. What's your point?

Being called a cuck by a stranger online isn't comparable. Their insult isn't meant to change your mind so much as it's meant to be hostile and offensive. It's not effective as "cuck" is not an emotionally charged word. If they were trying to manipulate you at the very least they are doing a shitty job of it.
