> Can you explain to me why you think racial and gender barriers are analogous

Yeah, I actually think this in the strict definition sense in that they are comparable *in certain respects*. In this case, I think the impact of a female president to gender relations is comparable to the impact of a black president to race relations (very little, if anything positive)

> A role model in the sense of "a woman can be a president too."

But how is that not already true? Of course a woman can be president.

> That shit is inspiring, and inspiration has objective utility in that it motivates people and increases mood

I might be able to accept that this is true, but why is motivating woman more important than motivating other groups? If we had to pick and choose, I'd say that woman should in fact be the very last group to get this benefit since they are objectively the majority over men.
