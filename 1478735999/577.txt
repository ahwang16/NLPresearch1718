Let me start by saying I strongly agree with your statment "I think it is a good exercise to for Trump haters to think about why someone would support Trump outside of being racist, sexist, etc."

I don't like Hilary either but still don't think Trump deserves support. So my question is simple - why did you vote for Trump?
