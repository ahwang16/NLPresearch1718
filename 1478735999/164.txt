I didn't vote for Trump. I didn't want him or her to win, equally. 

I can see the reasons people voted for either candidate, a third party, or didn't vote at all. I also actually respect the vote that people made.

I just strongly dislike the Clinton family, especially Hillary. I have hated her since the Benghazi aftermath because she wanted to be my boss and tell me to go to war, yet I can't trust her to tell my family the truth about why I died? Anyone who believes her story over the men that were there that night has either never been in the military or has their head buried in the sand.

That is something politicians will never come back from to get my vote, in my mind. It is why, even though I thought she would win, I take satisfaction in knowing that the dream she has been chasing since the early 90's always ends up just out of her grasp and that on her deathbed she will look back and have to face the fact that Donald Trump earned more votes than she did. 

It's ok though, she has those Bilderberg meetings she can still go to and she still has millions of dollars.
