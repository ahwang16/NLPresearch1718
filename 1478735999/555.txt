>Is the law always morally correct?

No. It does its best. But you can't admonish someone for playing by the rules, especially if he didn't make them.

>Do you think it Is fair to punish those who commit minor transgressions but not trump for his actions against women, employees, business partners and generally everyone else he could exploit?

This one's a loaded question. Please rephrase.

>So you think that the law always works and works fairly?

It doesn't. But again, you can't get upset about someone following the rules. What I can get upset about, and do, are politicians complaining about "loopholes" which have been around for decades, and then doing nothing to change the rules.
