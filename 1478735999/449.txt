Nobody is claiming they were equal throughout the entire history. They couldn't even vote until 1920. Women don't run for president frequently(because most of the ones wealthy enough to do so are not intelligent, OR they have no desire to be in power), if only 5 women have even run for president, it is not remotely surprising that none of them have won.
