>By that logic, anyone whose interests don't align with the winning candidate (i.e. anyone who votes for the losing candidate) is not being "represented" by the government.

That's why we also vote for members of congress, state, and local officials, to make sure we're as represented as possible...

>And conversely, anyone whose interests align with the winning candidate but who did not vote is being represented. You're contradicting yourself.

Yes, they got lucky. But representation by government shouldn't be luck. Democracy is rule by the people, democratic governments are supposed to forward the interests of the people. They can't just hope to correctly guess the interests of the people who don't vote...

The general principle is very simple... 

>With more power comes more responsibility

In democracies the people get more power in the form of voting and civil rights, and they expect the government to serve the people. That means they have a greater responsibility to make sure that happens, by voting and active political participation in other ways.

>It is not a duty to vote. It's a right.

In some democracies it is a legal duty to vote, just like it's a legal duty to attend jury duty. Why shouldn't it be a duty, either moral or legal, to vote?
