It's certainly possible. But I think you see what I'm saying. Look at how many Americans are depressed and even scared by the results of yesterday's election: it is clearly an emotional time for people and Trump hasn't even assumed office yet. Imagine the emotions that would result from a female President-Elect. Emotions are a powerful thing; we build our lives and decisions around them whether we think we do or not. A president not only leads us politically but also leads us in how we feel about ourselves and the world and country in which we live. The power of emotion is too significant to be ignored, and electing a female president would certainly be a galvanizing event emotionally.
