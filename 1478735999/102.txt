Do you want me to explain the difference between a generic surrogate and a Surrogate who is first in line to inherit the presidency in the case of his death and is the deciding vote in a Senate tie? Either way, most people assume the VP is closer to the President than say, some random former mayor from XYZville. Hillary can easily frame Bernie as her moral center, as Obama tries to do with Biden.
