Don't see Hillary discouraging Sanders supporters, because she wouldn't be the top of the ticket. She wins black voters with the Clinton name and lets Bernie play as being her moral center. Bernie plays Hillary off as a tool to gain consensus to pass policy because Bernie was an independent who caucused with Democrats. If dick Cheney was not enough to doom GWB at the top of the ticket, Hillary would not doom Bernie.

Bloomberg is ostensibly a Republican. The grain works both ways. It is more likely Bloomberg takes voters from Trump than from Bernie. It's possible that Bloomberg becomes the flag for Republicans to assemble under and Trump gets pushed out, but that's even farther speculation and wayyy above my pay grade. But either way I would much prefer a Hillary-B vs Bloomberg race than a Hillary vs Trump race.

Your next argument doesn't work against my argument though. All I was saying was that a Hillary/Bernie combo wins more black people than Hillary/Kaine, especially since black millennials actually know who Bernie is.

I dont think He's a commie" is very successful with former union workers. Maybe it works a little bit to the middle, but its not a more effective line than Crooked Killary, especially because the "USSR" sympathizer would not play with what Trump seems to feel- that its okay to say Putin is an all right guy, against the views of his own VP no less. Not sure he runs with this line.

I'm on my phone and my phone doesn't have copy/paste but Dems win in high turnout elections. Its a short google search.
