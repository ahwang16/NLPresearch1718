> All things being equal, close to 50% of presidents should have been women

I totally disagree. 100% of the presidents should be the best person for the job, regardless of their gender.

Let's say this election it would be the turn for a female president. But the candidate "they" came up with is an idiot and the other candidate, a man, is much better suited for the job. Why should a female be chosen just because of her gender when we really need the best person for that position.
