US politics are extremely polarizing, and that makes catchy, aggressive generalizations painfully common coming from both sides. For democrats, it's calling racism and bigotry. For republicans, it's accusations of "SJWs" and "naive millennials," not to mention "crooked Hillary". It's like political parties are sports teams, complete with obnoxiously smug trash talking.

If you've only noticed this from liberals, that probably just means you've been mainly surrounded by liberal views, and/or only notice condescension and shaming when you personally disagree with the ideas.

Extremism is alienating to the other side, but is also part of having a passionate support base and group identity. It's impossible to unite a political campaign without making it clear what you stand for, which means setting yourself apart from what you oppose in no uncertain terms. I really can't see any situation ending in a "revenge" vote that didn't already stem from these sorts of vast political differences.

Trump alienated and insulted tons of people with his callousness and far-right policies. He would never acknowledge that "people might have a legitimate reason to vote for" Hillary, to the point where he was prepared to call the system rigged if she won. Do you think his campaign would have been stronger if it tried to make him more appealing to liberals and moderates?

Any strong conviction sounds unbearably smug if you disagree with it, and there is sadly little room for moderation in the current battle arena of American politics.
