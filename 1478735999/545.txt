The charges that were brought up against his company wasn't that he wasn't renting to poor people. It was that he didn't rent to black people. 

Please keep things factual. 

Why is this different from any other civilian who believes OJ Simpson is guilty even though he was cleared?

Because he was running for president. 


I do give credibility to that runs the KKK because he is an expert on racism. It does concern me when that person says that Trump supports his cause. 

Kind of confirms my ideas that racism is allowed in the Trump tent. That it has a place.

Please don't deflect. Just answer the question.
