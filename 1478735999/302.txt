>> So how exactly do liberals get across to Trump supporters the very rational reason why minorities, lgbt individuals, etc. Are fucking terrified right now in a way that you'll actually listen to?

>They could start by not calling us deplorables, by not making false accusations of racism and by not using such condescending and divisive rhetoric. 

It seems ironic that you would bring up the divisive rhetoric, given that Trump's campaign was pretty much built upon it. Trump said pretty nasty things about his opponents, racial minorities, women and individuals for the entirety of his campaign.

But that notwithstanding, an excellent example of the problems people are having is that Pence supports gay conversion therapy. Frankly, it's patently ridiculous as a concept.
