Upvoting because I see that "deplorables" comment taken out of context every time it's mentioned. It is undeniably true that Trump had some awful, racist, sexist supporters who are deplorables. It's also true that they aren't all like that. The Clinton attack machine is so effective I see this used by Sanders supporters all the time.
