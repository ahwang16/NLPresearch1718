CMV: READING BOOKS IS VIRTUALLY POINTLESS.

These days, I am addicted to reading books I loved when I was a teenager. I'll tell you why I am reading them.

Ever since high school, I've plunged into a depression-like stage. I don't exactly have depression, but I am miserable, have no idea what I am doing with my life, lost interest in a lot of things, and feel like I have no goals to aspire to. Becoming an adult means realising that I will have more responsibilities and go to work and that's not fun.

Nowadays I read young adult series that I loved when I was a teenager and I fell in love with them again. Why? Because it's my way of escaping from my real life problems. Reading allows me to enter a world free of real-life stress. When I read, I see the world from the point of view of the protagonist. I get to fight monsters and go on adventures like the protagonist.

And like you've said, it's fictional. And yes, I understand that I read as a way of running away from real life problems. It did make me feel happier during my depressed phase in life though.
