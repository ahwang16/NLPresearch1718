There is nothing wrong with criticizing.

As citizens of a free society, Americans have the right to criticize in (among other things) online forums and in-person conversation and articles. However, there seems to be an increasing trend of criticizing and shaming people for being critical of abstaining from voting, particularly on social media. 

You simply don't have any reasonable expectation or right of not being criticized.
