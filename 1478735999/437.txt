CMV: I DON'T THINK ELECTING A FEMALE PRESIDENT IS IMPORTANT

Other commenters have addressed the fallacies of your argument so I am going to take a different approach. Imagine the situation was reversed: all presidents in US history have been female. And not only that, but the vast majority of politicians and high-ranking public officials have also always been female. Try to empathize with how this would affect yourself and other male people. Policies and laws, including any issues that specifically and exclusively impact male people, are almost entirely decided and legislated by female people - many of whom publicly and blatantly disrespect, ignore and/or misunderstand male issues and concerns. It is a vicious cycle in which males are far less likely to become involved in politics, even though - as half the population - they have a vested interest in political issues and could bring another perspective to the table, which is always a good thing when it comes to democratic systems of governance. 

Now imagine for the first time in history, after decades of male people working towards increasing male participation in their own government, a male person is a major presidential candidate. Would you not consider this something to celebrate and appreciate? Of course gender should not be the only reason you vote for him, but assuming his policies and ideals align with your own, assuming he is just as (if not more) qualified than the other options, wouldn't the fact that he's male be a positive and important plus? Or do you honestly believe you wouldn't consider it important?
