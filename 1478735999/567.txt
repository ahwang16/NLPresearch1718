> Saying an occasional racist / sexist joke doesn't make you racist / sexist

I thought on this matter, and would say it does. Because if you're not a racist/sexist, you simply won't find such jokes to be funny to start with.

A part of say, a sexist joke is drawing a distinction between genders and pointing something negative about the one being joked about. Like "women are so dumb, right?"

Someone who isn't a sexist doesn't subscribe to that line of thought at all. The joke either falls flat because the person doesn't even recognize the stereotype being invoked, or is seen as offensive. Either way, the joke just won't get told.
