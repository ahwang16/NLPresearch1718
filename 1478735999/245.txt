Even Paul Ryan called it *the definition of a racist statement*. You can't pin that one on liberals. 

You seem to be mad when somebody says something is racist when you don't believe it is racist. But what if *they* genuinely believe it is racist? Should they consult you? There clearly is a disagreement here about what counts as racism.

MLK annoyed people. Susan B Anthony annoyed people. Is it really so important to avoid annoying people when fighting for equality?
