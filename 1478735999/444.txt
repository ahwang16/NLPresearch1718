>There is still this stigma associated with men being around young children, especially un-married men

Absolutely, and I think it's important for boys/men (and girls/women) to see men in such positions. There are definitely some industries that discriminate against men - teaching as you mentioned, also nursing and fashion off the top of my head. Men in these industries are assumed to be creepy, gay or otherwise inferior and I can imagine there are social difficulties faced by men working in female-dominated environments just like there are for women in male-dominated environments. That's why it's important to have role models who challenge these restrictive norms and teach children and young adults that their sex does not have to determine their career choice.
