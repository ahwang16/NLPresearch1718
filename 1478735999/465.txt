>I would argue that having your voice heard in a protest when others do not want to hear it is close to a waste of time.

Seriously?  thats exactly what all protests are, making your voice heard when people wouldn't otherwise listen.  obviously this case isn't on the same scale, but how long would martin luther king have waited to have a sincere discussion about civil rights in the south?
