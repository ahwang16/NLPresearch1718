CMV: I DON'T THINK ELECTING A FEMALE PRESIDENT IS IMPORTANT

Fulling willing (and somewhat expecting) a view change here, I'm frankly surprised I haven't been able to find any objective reason why the first female president is all that important.

**Context:**  I'm not really comfortable with labels, but I think the closest one for me on gender issues is egalitarian. Also, I'm not and never have been a Trump supporter (Rand Paul was who I liked most).

-  I find it extremely important that all genders (and ethnicity) have the legal right to run for president, but what people do with that right, what the result of it is, I don't find that important at all. In the same way, I was very happy when marijuana was legalized in my state, but I don't care how many people choose to practice their new legal right to use it. It's just important that if they wanted to use it, they could.

- If someone feels that sexism is a huge issue in America right now, I can't think of any logical reason why they would think that a female president would be a solution to that problem. Obama has been in office 8 years, and race relations are worse today than when he entered office.

- I don't believe in the idea that a male president is incapable of fairly electing supreme court justices that will defend a woman's right to choose. Obama's recent nomination of Garland is proof of this.

- I don't believe a male president is incapable of being considerate of woman. And even if this were true, then it would mean that as soon as a female were president, now it is men that are being oppressed. It isn't, and shouldn't be, a "now it's **our** turn!" system.

- I am not comfortable with gender being a point of significance during an election. Just as I wouldn't be comfortable with a candidate stating "you should vote for me because I am a man", I'd be equally uncomfortable with a woman stating we should vote for her because she's a woman.

- Even if I were to accept that a female president would be some sort of "victory", why is that more important than a first Jewish president, or Muslim president, or Arabic president, or Latino president, or Asian president? Why are the needs of women more important than the needs of those groups and others? (This is why I'm not comfortable with ethnicity, religion, or gender being brought up as a positive or negative during elections).

In short, I can't find any objective reasoning for why it's of utmost importance to have a female president, and need one in order for my view to be changed.
