It sounds like you're already disagreeing with your title. Maybe you don't like supporting Clinton *because* she's a woman, but you do understand that having women politicians (and presidents) is important. All that drives people to vote for her because she's a woman is that dame attitude, but with more value ascribed to it than you seem to.
