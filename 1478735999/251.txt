> I would consider them racist, since Hitler was actually racist, not just opposed to immigration.

Donald Trump said, "Laziness is a trait in blacks ... I believe that. No black person will be president again any time soon."

Stop with the bullshit and accept reality. He's an unabashed racist. His speeches trying to appeal to blacks were flat-out racist in their assumptions. His advocacy of stop-and-frisk is FACTUALLY racist. And yes, he KNOWS it was struck down by the supreme court FOR BEING RACIST. Combined with his comments about the American judge with ancestry from Mexico and the Muslim ban... how can you just not see based on the evidence? I could seriously go on for a lot longer but I'm not sure if you haven't accepted it by now that you'll ever listen to reason. 

I would understand a couple of clumsy sentences here and there as being misconstrued as racist. But not just his words but his actions are CONSTANTLY reinforcing the image of a bigot. I would grant you if it was only a couple things but... there have been damn-near books showing evidence of his racism. 

Occam's Razor this shit out.
