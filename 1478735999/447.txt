No offense but I think you simply don't understand statistics. If there were a country where men and women were truly equal throughout its whole history and this country had 50 presidents over the past 200 years then you would except around 25 of those presidents to be female. Currently the US has zero.

Obviously the US wasn't an equal country throughout its history. But let's look at the last five presidents. If the probability were equal for a woman and a man then you would expect at least two women. The probability of getting five men in a row is just 3%. So either women in the US are very unlucky or, more likely, chances for woman to win are still far smaller than for men.

So basically it's true that it isn't relevant that Hillary didn't win but it's hard to explain that never any woman wins.
