I suppose he could've made up that deficit with his advantage in his support among millennials.

If they turned out in larger numbers the Dem candidate probably would've won. Pretty big 'if' though. 

The youth vote has traditionally been pretty worthless in American politics.

Personally, I don't believe he would have done better. Probably worse given that his far-left policies would've been a turn off for the moderate voters that tend to make up a high percentage of the electorate in the general.
