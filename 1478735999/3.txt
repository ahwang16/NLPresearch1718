CMV: HEARTHSTONE IS A BAD CARD GAME

The most competitive decks have very little RNG in the cards. There is always RNG in what card you draw next and what your opening hand is, but that is just what makes it a card game. 

> To me the funnest parts of card games are not winning but to make cool decks and refine them but as hearthstone is now if you do that you wont make it past rank 8 at best and that was with a 40% win rate vs zoo.

Well that's a problem. Because it's the "fun" decks are the ones that tend to have higher RNG. Zoo has almost none. 

Another problem is that people want to play fun decks but they turn out not to be so fun when your win rate is lower than 40%. It's like you're building a deck around what you want the game to be rather than what it is. Learning what decks are strong in which matchups is tough, and once you've done that you have to figure out the meta game and plan for it. If you don't think that process is fun then no CCG will be fun for you at a competitive level. 

Right now I'm playing healadin with Anyfin. It's pretty consistent and I enjoy the deck. It's a deck archetype that is familiar but it isn't just a netdeck because I enjoy experimenting with card substitutions. My earlier experimental build it was a combination N'Zoth/Anyfin deck which was fun to explore as well. But checking out guides for thoroughly tested decks is definitely a great place to start. 

Just running a netdeck may not be fun but that isn't what you should be doing anyway. You should be trying to figure out how the deck works and why the cards were chosen. Once you've done that (1) you will play the deck better and (2) you will be equipped to alter and customize the deck intelligently.
