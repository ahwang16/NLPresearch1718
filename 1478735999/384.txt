> It was ruled by the Supreme Court as racist. 

That's simply not true. In fact stop and frisk as a tactic is Constitutional. A US District Judge in the Southern District of New York in 2013 ruled that the ways in which it was being carried out in NYC were unconstitutional, and policies were put in place to change it. 

> And yes, banning all Muslims because a small group of them is incredibly, INCREDIBLY xenophobic

A temporary ban was proposed to review the policies for filtering out radical extremists. There are precedents for such bans, such as when FDR set up a temporary ban against Japanese, Italian, and German immigrants following the attacks on Pearl Harbor. 

Trump's proposed ban was in reaction to the Syrian refugee crisis. The Syrians practice Sharia law, which is a toxic form of Islam. And we have been experiencing increasingly violent Islamic terrorist attacks at home and around the world. 

So while I find it problematic, I don't see this as evidence that if a reasonable person approved of this, they are automatically xenophobic.
