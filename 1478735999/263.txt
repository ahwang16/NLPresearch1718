Privilege, as I see it being used, is a way of framing certain emergent properties of societal systems. It appears at a specific "resolution" of society, and loses its accuracy at other resolutions. I don't think that it should be the primary way of framing human experience, there are certain psychological factors and value systems that precede privilege , and if we focus on positive values (compassion, etc) I think the defensiveness that discussions based on privilege give rise to will be circumvented.
