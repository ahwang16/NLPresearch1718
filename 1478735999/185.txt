Attempting to manipulate someone's decisions by calling them emotionally charged names is absolutely abusive. The individual words used are irrelevant, it's the intent behind argument as a whole.

The actions taken by Clinton supporters on my Facebook were atrocious and chilling. They prevented healthy discourse with their vitriolic emotional responses. I didn't see *any* support for Trump until after the election, and it's because people were afraid of being attacked.
