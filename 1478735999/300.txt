False accusations? Condescending and decisive rhetoric? These are the things that drive minority voters away from the Republican party... I mean, your VP pick was defunding HIV research to use federal money to support gay conversion therapy. Red leaders have recently been passing laws that would make it illegal for me to USE THE BATHROOM. I am considered less than human by the Republican platform. I think it's reasonable for me to have some amount of disdain for those voting in line with those ideals.
