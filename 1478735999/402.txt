This is not a man's world. Women have it made, they pretty much don't have to work if they are somewhat attractive, and they can claim sexism/call rape on any man whenever they want. They also don't have to participate in the draft. If a war starts, I could be yanked out of school and forced into sacrificing my life, but they don't have to worry in the slightest. It's ridiculous that you could even SUGGEST that women have it hard in our world.
