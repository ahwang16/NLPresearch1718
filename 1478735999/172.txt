That's apples and oranges.  First, Trump said that if he lost, it was rigged.  Second, he didn't dismiss contesting the election if he lost.  Third, Since there is absolutely no proof of widespread election fraud (like he stated there was), it only makes sense to get upset when the loser contests the election.  However, since Hillary's speech isn't being made to Trump's supporters, they shouldn't be the ones to dictate how Hillary's supporters feel about the speech being made the next day.
