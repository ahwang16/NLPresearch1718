I hear what you're saying and I really agree with you. During the next two years it's critical for the American Left to work with rural whites to establish common goals and end the insane division in our politics. Democrats can't draw lines in the sand and retreat into their cities if they want their opinions to be reflected in government. 

However, it really frustrates me that so many people felt it was reasonable to put the planet (and the security of NATO and Europe) at risk, just to "stick it to the man". The problems Trump may cause (in my opinion, almost certainly WILL cause) are so much bigger than an argument about smug rhetoric and culture.
