I don't use books for entertainment, I use books for knowledge.

Books have so much information about certain subjects that you can use to excel at in your job and hobbies. 

Books have an advantage over movies/tv shows because they are cheaper and faster to produce than movies/tv shows. 

There isn't any commercials or advertising in books. I never understood why anyone would pay for something that has advertising in it.
