CMV: THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH NOT VOTING. NOBODY SHOULD BE CRITICIZED FOR FAILING/REFUSING TO VOTE.

I don't understand what he said that changed your view enough to award a delta. I swear those things are handed out like candy corn. The biggest point of your argument was not defeated, just qualified on a skew. I think that person's implication of why there is non-vote blame is unsubstantiated. As you say, they could vote the opposite way and the fault lies with the critic's thinking/assumption. The original critic is the one who is most likely wrong.

This topic is important to me. I possess the same view as OP and I'm not convinced. The only thing that makes a slight blow in my view is when someone says that not voting makes the candidate not care about you and that's what they want. They want a person like me to not vote. That sort of manipulation is what could get me to vote but it's not enough.

1.) Jerrymandering. Can't fight that built into the system with just my vote.
2.) Can't vote against the people who make bad supreme court decisions like the one ruling over financing campaigns.
3.)Can't fight the biased mass media with my vote. They only show or advertise the main candidates instead of including 3rd party Presidential candidates. Why do we not see 3rd party participants in the final 3 debates? We saw this corrupt bias explicitly in collusion with Hillary's campaign.
4.) We could do nothing against the DNC with our votes.

These attributes marginalize voting if not rendering it pointless. We'd need like a 70% total population movement which is impossible considering how much they deliberately divide us on nonsense like race.

If they really cared about voting turn out they wouldn't make it deliberately difficult to do so nor ship buses around to commit voter fraud.

Our vote's power isn't enough.
