>I do not believe that Trump has ever made a racist statement during his campaign

I challenge this notion. Trump has called for re-instituting stop and frisk in "inner cities" - both the policy position and terminology used is inherently racist.

He has advocated openly for profiling, especially touting the Israeli model. He has tried to skirt around it by saying he never said "muslims", just people who looked "suspicious". Need I say more?

He also has a pretty spotty history with african american employees, and native americans linked to his casino business.

Just the couple things that instantly came to mind this late at night, but I hope you see where I'm going with this.
