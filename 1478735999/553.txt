>typically the federal government is not a group of people who sue for

Did the federal government find any wrongdoing? I do a lot of research on different companies, so I'm well aware that companies are sued and investigated very frequently. The finding of wrongdoing and actual penalties are rare.

>So if the women will retract, it hasn't happened yet.

Weren't these accusations of events from decades ago? Is it a coincidence that they all decide to sue together, a week before the election? Does it feel orchestrated?
