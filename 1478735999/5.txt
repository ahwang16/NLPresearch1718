> But on ladder current rank 2 every zoo deck is effectively the same but I've faced more aggro shaman than anything else and they are all the same card for card to the point I made a shadow heal priest deck to outlive the aggro decks that are so common. 

That's two deck archetypes, and there actually are plenty of variations within those two archetypes. Neither are the most likely top 8 tournament decks. C'Thun Druid and Warrior, control warrior, control priest, and deathrattle rogue are all top tier decks right now. 

Control Warrior has great matchups with zoo and shaman aggro, and so does healadin (which is definitely *not* a tier 1 deck, but a solid tier 2). 

If most of your matchups are against the same two decks then finding a good counter deck shouldn't be so hard. Most people who complain about facing the same decks over and over complain because those decks beat the hell out of the deck they want to play, but choosing the deck you want to play before analyzing the meta is doing things backwards. If you do that you're going to have a bad time. 

It seems like you're complaining about how other people play, but that should not limit how you play. Read some great deck guides and experiment. Nothing is stopping you. But there is a world of difference between experimenting with "fun" decks without the help of online resources and experimenting carefully to find what wins.

By the way, I don't know if you've checked out /r/CompetitiveHS but it's a great resource.
