If Trump supporters start to ask for facts instead of just the narrative.  If they start to hold him accountable when he lies...maybe. If they start to use critical thinking skills to examine critical stories about Trump rather than simply dismiss them as media attacks.... maybe. 

That's the best outcome I could see. 

Then again I'm not really a strong advocate for any of that happening. 

A lot of people voted for him because they liked what Trump was telling him. Maybe those people will turn away from Trump but since lots of Trump supporters tend to deflect or cover for him when confronted with negative facts about Trump i don't know. 

I really don't. But I guess that could happen.
