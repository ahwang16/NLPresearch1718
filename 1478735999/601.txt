Well..that's the point though.  You're getting _criticized_, not splashed, or otherwise harmed.  These are words, not water.  I'm assuming that this criticism isn't threatening or doesn't attempt to inspire anyone to hurt you, to not employ you, or to do anything other than get you to change your behavior. It is a zero-harm activity.  Sure there are _ways_ I could criticize you that are wrong, but you don't have any reason to think that all perspectives that are different from yours come with your own mute button.

It is reasonable to want to live in a democratic society where elected officials reflect the will of _all people_. I can regard that as a good in and of itself.  That you disagree with me has nothing to do with diddly.
