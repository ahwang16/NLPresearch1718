This all seems like you're making a "we are a little bit racist/sexist, but its not that bad." type of argument. 

Non Trump supporters get to disagree with you on that. 

And I know it is quite the claim, but I'm making it anyway. 

Half the people heard sexist words being spoken and didn't really care as long as they were hearing messages they wanted to hear. 

This is this massive disconnect between trump supports and those who are critical of Trump. 

I have head Trump say things on tape and  then I've heard Trump deny that he said those things. 

This isn't up to debate. He lied. Many times. 

Everyone heard these lies, but half the population didn't care as long as he was saying what they wanted to hear. 

And to be frank with you, that scares us when we hear people telling us to trust what he says. 

I've heard what he says. He lies a lot. He says what people want to hear....a lot.
