The polls weren't entirely wrong. The national polls had her up 3% with a margin of error of 2-3% depending on the quality of the poll.

Bernie didn't need to do a lot better than Clinton remember. He just needed to increase on her share by 1.3% and he would have flipped Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.

Hillary ran on getting a big turnout from the usual Democratic coalition of women, minorities and millenials. The problem is that she didn't get enough millenials who Sanders was hugely popular with. Sanders would have gotten the majority of women and the minority vote because Sanders was well liked by them too. In some states they just liked Clinton better.

You've also got to factor in that Sanders did very well among the white working class in the primaries so would have hurt Donalds chances to some degree in that group.

With the reliable Democrats, more enthusiasm for his campaign, more millenials, the right outsider save the middle class antifree trade mesage and support from working whites it seems impossible to me that he wouldn't have got that 1.3% extra to win.
