When people are protesting Trump, they're not protesting the man's election per se - though there is something to be said for Clinton's popular vote win being troublesome in terms of what decides presidency, people understand that he was elected relatively fairly (minus voter disenfranchisement in states like North Carolina, but that wouldn't have changed the outcome). When people are protesting Trump, they're protesting everything he stands for - misogyny, racism, xenophobia, fascistic tendencies, the like. I think you understand this:

>  Fighting the elusive ideas of racism, sexism, and hate with marching and shouting will not work. But by discussing, teaching, and enlightening those who stand for hate and racism one on one, instead of simply marching en masse -which often leads to violence and resentment from the opposition- we will be much more successful in changing the country for the better and stopping the destruction of Democratic values and common morality.

I generally agree that interpersonal dialogue is more productive than shouting in the streets. However, the thing about protesting is that it's about having your voice heard. People are making noise because they are deeply dissatisfied with the results, and while that might not immediately change a Trump supporter's view, it will make them notice them - and that's more effective than no noise in the first place.
