I think getting fired over your political views definitely qualify as persecution, and is also illegal, but hard to prove. Watching Trump supporters get attacked definitely qualifies as persecution.

My friends not taking kindly to Trump supporters? I'll give you that one.

>Your experiences with Trump opponents sound exactly like mine with his supporters.

As someone in a blue state, I'm interested in hearing more. What are the things they say about Hilary supporters?
