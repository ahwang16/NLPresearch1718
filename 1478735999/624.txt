I knew going into this that Gary Johnson had no chance in hell of winning.  I knew he wasn't going to win my state.  I knew he wasn't going to win ANY state.  But that was never the point.

I voted for who I believed in.  I voted for the person that I wanted to be President (at least out of this bunch), so I can confidently say that even though my person didn't win, my voice was heard.  My vote counted.  And even if they disregard it completely, Washington knows that a few million of us wanted the country to go that direction.  

And isn't that how it's supposed to be?  You vote for who you want, and so does everyone else, and whoever gets the most votes wins.  If I were to cast my vote for anyone besides the person that I wanted, just to strategically prevent someone else from winning, then I wouldn't be voting for someone, I'd be voting AGAINST someone.  I'd be voting specifically to cancel out someone else's vote, and that to me is highly undemocratic.
