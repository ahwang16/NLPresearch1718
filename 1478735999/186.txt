>Attempting to manipulate someone's decisions by calling them emotionally charged names is absolutely abusive. 

No its not. Would you compare that experience to the homeless woman who was attacked for defending Trump's Star? Or the people who worked at the fire bombed RNC center, or anyone who lost their job for political reasons?

People on the right called me a cuck. I didn't give a shit because names are just names. I defended DA:II on launch  and still defend it to this day, and Internet dumbasses got absurdly worked up over it. Grown ass men have "challenged me to fights" over the Internet because of disagreements about video game lore. Vitriol is vitriol and abuse is abuse. 

Nobody who's not already insane is going to turn around and grope a woman because people were mean to him in this election season. Nobody who wasn't already really racist is going to turn around and wrongfully report a black man's presence as "suspicious activity" because they were wrongfully called racist. This isn't a cycle of abuse. 

And to be clear, there *is* a real cycle of back and forth abuse. I know a really truly racist white guy who is that way because really truly racist black kids abused the shit out of him growing up. I know guys who have been abused by women and felt like they couldn't get any support, ending up becoming pretty misogynistic. I also know people on all sides who have risen above. But screaming abuse when people are loud and vitriolic on the Internet just discredits you when there's real abuse (and I think that's true of fucking everyone, though as a white guy with runic tattoos I'll admit Im more comfortable calling it out against people like me).
