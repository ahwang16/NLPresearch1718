> Again, what are you to do with a voting base motivated by spite ?

Not make them spiteful?

Responsibility and blame are just diversions from the argument that OP's trying to lay outâ€”separate arguments that, while valid and worth discussing, are not the one being proposed here. People's actions influence the actions of others. Being extremely aggressive about your views breeds contempt, and in this case, might have bred Trump voters out of people who wouldn't have voted for him.

And I say this as a liberal. The most progressive people I know are often the most insufferable, the most unable to entertain the ideas of their political opponents, and it's frustrating because I feel they're doing more harm than good.
