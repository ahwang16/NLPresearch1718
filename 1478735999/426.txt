1. "importance" is never objective, so asking for objective reasons for it is setting us up for a real challenge!

2. I take it that you think being egalitarian IS objectively important. So...lets start from there as a premise even if others might think that being egalitarian isn't important!

3. I'll also assume that you think that women are equally capable of being president have the capacity to be president as well as men and so on. That is, we don't have a qualification problem with women per se - they are as likely to be qualified for the role as men.

4. Right there we've got a problem and I'd suggest that as someone who is an egalitarian you probably actually do think it is important that a women be elected president.  Not _all the time_, but roughly half the time.  

I'd suggest that it's not all that reasonable to be both a believer in the equality of women and not thinking that it is important to elect a female president.  While it's arguable that it's not important to elect _this_ female president as there is nothing in these probabilities that necessitates that she is the best qualified candidate, it's also essentially impossible that we never elect female presidents.  Since we never have, we've got a crushing problem with your objective importance of being egalitarian.  We are clearly failing to achieve it.
