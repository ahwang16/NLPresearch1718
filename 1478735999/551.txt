>Actually, this is untrue - he was literally sued by the Department of Justice for racist housing discrimination in the '70s.

I'm well aware of the article. But you might not be aware that Trump was not sued. His company was sued. It's an important distinction. Companies get sued every day for all sorts of baseless and unreasonable things by people trying to get money. McDonalds was sued for making kids fat. McDonalds was sued for targeting black people. Microsoft was sued for 100 dollars by some guy who knew Microsoft would not spend the $1000 per hour lawyer fee to fight him.

>However, if the law being broken is sexual assault, as Trump is currently in court for, that might be worse.

Wasn't this all propaganda? Didn't all the women retract when it came down to put their names down on legal documents?
