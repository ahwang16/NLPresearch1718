I think it's worth pointing out the different dynamics between the primary and general election. In the primaries each state has different rules for who can and can't vote in a primary and how early you must register. In addition to that, turnout for primaries will simply be lower compared to the general. If a candidate does poorly in a particular state in the primary you can't just say he will do poorly in that state against a different opponent in the general.

It's also worth noting the different messages and rhetoric used by the two campaigns. Clinton's racist and sexist accusations fell flat while Trump's anti-establishment message resonated strongly with the working class and in the rust belt. We don't know for sure but it would be safe to assume Sanders commitment to tackling income inequality would have been more appealing to voters in the rust belt compared to Clinton's.
