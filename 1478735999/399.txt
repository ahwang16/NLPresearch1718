This is mainstream knowledge. Men take greater risks than women. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective and matches our evolutionary cousins. Men also make up the smartest (and the dumbest) in the population. Their bell-curve for intelligence is wider, in other words.

I'm not going to pretend that it is solely "nature" rather than nuture, but I'm also not going to pretend to know what the exact division of labor/roles is by sex for ANY field. The 50/50 ideal is unrealistic, though. Men and women's brains are different, as well. It's not just physical differences, though those are of course more obvious and easy to understand.

And before anyone strawmans i'm not saying anyone SHOULD do ANY specific thing. I'm all for equal opportunity and freedom of choice. Equal opportunity by definition is not equality of outcome (considering men and women are different)
