Trump ran on a platform of job creation and holding American corporations accountable for shipping jobs overseas. He promised economic growth and "putting America back to work."

How more blatantly can you show support for working class people than that? The argument isn't whether or not he can deliver on those promises, it's whether or not people voted for him because they believed he could.
