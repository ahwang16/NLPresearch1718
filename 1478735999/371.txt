CMV: PEOPLE ARE MISTAKEN TO THINK THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS VOTED FOR HIM FOR RACIST, SEXIST, OR XENOPHOBIC REASONS

&#8710; This does show evidence of a higher preponderance of bigots in support for Trump over other candidates in the South Carolina primaries in this particular survey.

Still, it looks like Trump places in fourth in net favorability behind Bush, Rubio, and Kasich. 43% of the participants in that poll expressed active dislike for him. Those 43% likely voted for him in the general election, so the percentages of bigots you point out were likely *much lower* in the general election in South Carolina.

It's also worth noting that 64% of Trump supporters in that survey viewed Ben Carson favorably (a black man and the only minority in the survey), and that Carson also polls neck in neck amongst Trump supporters' number two vote, at 19%, further dispelling the racism claim.

I also don't see stats on how many people were surveyed here, or what their demographics are, which of course makes a huge difference. 

Finally, that's one state, and a particularly bigoted, "deep south" state to boot. Even if the survey is comprehensive in who it's surveying, it's not an accurate representation of rural America.
