I am talking about all liberals, including the media and bystanders. Not just Clinton.

No, liberal made the argumetns to salty Bernie supporters to avoid trump because they were only interested in burning the place down, not actually worried about policy. If someone doesn't care about policy you don't keep talking policy with them.

>However, she still made some pretty inexcusable comments, like calling people deplorable and calling Trump racist.


Trump supporters are deplorable if they are throwing their support and weight behind a bigot. Racist means a lot of different things to different people, so sure, that one's debateable. But his policies are bigoted and xenophobic, and his comments towards women are incredibly sexist (as well as his comments about black people were INCREDIBLY racist last election cycle. Like holy shit racist).

I'm gonna use a godwin's law but what would you call a supporter of Hitler? Fucking awful. What if that person didn't like his racist policies but really loved his economic policies? Still deplorable. You legitimize a bigot and evil statsemen then you are also part responsible for his actions. If a friend tells me he wants to go out hunting to get us food and then go down to a grocery store and rob it, and I buy him a gun because I like the idea of getting fresh venison I don't get to distance myself from the robbery under the "I just wanted free food!" argument.
