> Look at how many Americans are depressed and even scared by the results of yesterday's election: it is clearly an emotional time for people and Trump hasn't even assumed office yet.

âˆ† Oh ya know what, this completely convinced me. Yeah, people are freaking out and throwing nasty labels at every person who voted Trump. They are acting completely irrationally (just in my circle that is).

The same thing, albeit temporary, should be true in the opposite as well. Instead of all this nastiness like today, in my circle I'd be surrounded by positivity. It'd be nice.
