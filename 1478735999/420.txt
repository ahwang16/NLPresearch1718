> And then I look at the list of presidents and I see 44.5 white faces looking at me and I see no women.

Isn't this a rather narrow area to be looking at?  If you look at other positions in the political world (US specifically) You see a trend of more women getting into positions of power.

I guess what I'm trying to say is instead of seeing despair in the fact that we have had no female president yet see hope in the fact that women are becoming more equally represented as time goes on.  Use that to encourage your students.
