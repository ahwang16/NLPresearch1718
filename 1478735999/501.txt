Right now there's more clean air than we know what to do with, its practically free there's no money in it. That's terrible

If all the air wasn't breathable then you be able to sell clean air for a profit! If anti-capitalist hippy tries to break up your monopoly on the clean air supply, you just have to hire a band of mercenaries to take them out.
