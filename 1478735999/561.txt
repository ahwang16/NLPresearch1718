Not the OP, but âˆ† for your analysis on why those distressed by Trump's election have legitimate reason behind any generalizations or misconceptions. I am not a fan of Trump and did not vote for him, but I   have had trouble viewing outcry as justified. I have been particularly worried that the "gloating and whining" from both sides is not only instructive of our nation's hyperpartisanship, but also a reason for its perpetuation. Your post may confirm that fear for me in some respects, but it also indicates to me the blame is unimaginably diffuse. A good take on the implications of a "shy Trump voter" beyond public polling.
