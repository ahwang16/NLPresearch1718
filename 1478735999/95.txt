A lot of good points here but I think you're point about the rust belt is really important. Clinton devoted a huge portion of her campaign to attacking Trump on perceived racism and sexism. These attacks fell flat, especially in the rust belt. The voters cared more about their personal economic status and accountability in Washington. In the primary Sanders showed a commitment to tackling income inequality while Clinton's approach wasn't seen as genuine. Combine this with Sander's opposition to big corporate donors and his message reaches more working class white people.
