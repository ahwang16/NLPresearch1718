> I believe that the vast majority of Trump supporters voted for him because they are working class and tired of feeling cheated by their government.

The issue isn';t that they voted for him BECAUSE of his bigotry (though undeniably a lot of people did, as evidenced by wide-spread support of racist orgs) but they voted for him DESPITE his bigoted policies. Which to me is just as bad.
