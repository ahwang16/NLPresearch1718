I believe you might be mistaking equality for equity. If men and women are 100% equal in a society that does not mean that all jobs would have a 1:1 male:female ratio. Men and women are biologically different, and to assume that biological traits have zero effect on career choices (or the path to these careers) would be ignoring a large amount of scientific research.
