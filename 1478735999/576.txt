It is unfair to assume that you are a racist and sexist but with all trump has done and said people associate your candidates views with your own since you did vote for him. (80% of woman republicans voted for him on the pro choice stance of Hilary) He has some really ignorant views that cause people to become hostel when it is completely different from their views. Just human nature I guess. (Also all the videos of people shouting kill Muslim, niggers, Mexicans at his rallies doesn't help)

I don't have any I'll will to anyone who voted for trump but I cannot accept the logic that his manipulation of hate is better than Hillary's corruption
