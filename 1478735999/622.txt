The value of a vote changes based on where you vote, and it goes up if you live in a smaller, closer state. A vote in this election was very powerful in various states. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia. All of those states were very close and thus your vote mattered much more there. And for some of those states, polling indicated otherwise.

Consequently, my personal pride is massively outweighed by the difference between what 2 presidential candidates want to accomplish. Presidential candidates probably cause a range of difference in generating utility that is billions of times greater than my own, because their policies or lack there of will effect millions of people, every moment that they are underway. If there is only a 1 - 10,000,000 chance that my vote will effect an election result that will cause something that will generate 10,000,000 times greater than my personal utility I might feel by voting for a person, then that vote is worth it. Also, a rational person should always seek to feel the most pleasure in maximising utility. And while many selfish activities provide a personal utility that is hard to ignore, a vote is simply a decision to get someone to make decisions on your behalf, and thus it makes more sense to feel the need to vote for a person who will maximise utility with those decisions, because that person would be the most likely to maximise YOUR utility in their process.
