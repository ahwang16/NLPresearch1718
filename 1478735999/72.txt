Few reasons:
Sanders has little scandalous material to be accused of. Even his rape fantasy essay was written decades ago and had little consequences unlike Trump's University and Hillary's email.
And even if people dug up some other events that makes Sanders look bad, Sanders' rhetoric often focused on the issues instead of ad hominem attacks. I am confident that if he was nominated the presidential debates would be a lot more civil and substantial, which could totally have made the difference.
Furthermore, A Sanders-Trump election would generate more voter turn out for Sanders. This year only half of the registered voters voted and many abstains or trump votes are due to the fact that they just don't like Hillary.
And about the Socialist labeling, Bernie claims himself as a democratic socialist, which is very different from your old fashioned socialist. If Bernie had been given  more time to explain his position (but he was scheduled to debate Clinton on weekdays during the times when tv traffics are minimal), he could've turned more Americans around. All in all, calling him a socialist to get Americans preemptively disapproving of him is one the dirtiest trick that his opponents used against him.

I know this is probably biased and I will admit that first thing, but those are very reasonable reasons to why I think Sanders would beat Trump.
