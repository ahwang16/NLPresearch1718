I would say that that's also important, and probably more important. In principle one would calculate by multiplying the representation benefit by the number of people in each group, though I couldn't tell you what the actual number for the "representation benefit" is. And that's why I celebrate that there are now four women of color in the Senate (one Somali American, one Indian American, and one Thai American join a Hawaiian lady) along with the first ever Latinx person to serve in the Senate. Similarly, I celebrate the first openly LGBT person to become a mayor.

I can't tell you what the tradeoff between "electability" and "minority representation bonus points" is in any quantifiable terms. But it is certainly a thing I think about when considering candidates. It's unlikely to make a difference over major policy points (especially in the current political climate with how far apart the parties are), but it does get some weight and will be a thing I get excited about when minorities (especially groundbreaking minorities) get elected.
