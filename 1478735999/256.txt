> You might not feel like what he said is so bad. I think it is, and I think people who champion it or even let it pass are also doing something bad. What I don't understand is why you find it so threatening. Why does it set off such an extreme reaction?

You are right, it is not a logical or productive reaction. But it is a reaction that many people have. When people call you something - especially something that you are not - it makes you very angry. not a good reason to vote, but it is a reason, and I think it cost Hillary a lot.

>But dude, if you're championing dialogue, then I gotta be able to call stuff you do racist without you freakin' out and voting for Trump out of revenge. 

Sure, and it is fine to call Trump out on his stances on immigration and muslims. Personally I agree with neither. But when you start calling him racist, you are intentionally misrepresenting the situation that that will make voters angry, me included.
