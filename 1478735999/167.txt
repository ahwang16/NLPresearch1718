>even though she knew it was a lie

Nobody can prove that she did or didn't believe what she said.  The burden of proof lies with those making the claims and nobody has been able to prove that.  I'm not saying she didn't know.  But it's incredibly irresponsible to present it as fact.  As far as lying to the deads' families, only two of the families blamed Clinton for what happened.  Are we to dismiss the others?
