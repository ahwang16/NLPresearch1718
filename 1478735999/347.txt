>Hillary called Trump supporters "deplorable"

Hillary said basically first, "You can't generalize this", and then "But I generalize some of his supporters, the racist ones, the neo nazis, and the KKK members, and the ones that attend muslim hate rallies 'deplorables'"...

And then people like you embraced being a KKK neonazi muslim hater.

People targeted by the overtly racist messages of the republicans and the trump campaign.

People on places like reddit that talk about sand people and shit like that.

And you don't even seem to know or even care what she really said.  You just operate on memes spoonfed you by the drumpf.
