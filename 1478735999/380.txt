Forgive me.

It got to the federal level where it was declared unconstitutional as how it was being practiced

And that's where it pretty much is because the city never fixed it probably because it couldn't be fixed as how they were using it. 

It was a blatant violation of 4th amed. rights. And that's not even examining the 14th amed arguments. 

It pretty hard to Consitutionally defend a program that stopped black and brown people 85 percent of the time. More so when you add in that 90 percent of people were totally innocent of anything. 

Last I checked American citizens do have the right to walk on the street without police harassment. 

then again if Trump packs the CS we will see if we have a 4th amend in four years.
