Where I live there is a high population of Muslims, refugees, gays, and undocumented immigrants. Everyone I know who is one of these groups is absolutely terrified of what will happen to them under a Trump presidency. The protests against Trump aren't against the system that voted him in, they are against the candidate himself. Will this accomplish anything legally speaking? Definitely not, but I think these protests are important. They are proof that though we have elected a President who considers these groups to be 2nd class citizens, there are plenty of people in America who are willing to fight for those groups' rights. I think this message is incredibly important in this difficult time, and I think it will help a lot of people feel that the future isn't hopeless. To me, that isn't futile.
