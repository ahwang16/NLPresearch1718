This is what OP needs to reply to. The key point here is that Trump got fewer votes than Romney. Clinton simply couldn't get enough enthusiasm. I haven't seen anyone make the same claim about Sanders. People hate Clinton so much that I'm highly skeptical more people would have voted for Trump if Sanders was the nominee.
