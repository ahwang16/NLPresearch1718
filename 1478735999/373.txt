> I could try to estimate the number of Trump supporters with bigoted views during the general election, by looking at the number of Trump/Cruz/Rubio, etc. supporters with bigoted views during the primaries

That would still leave us in South Carolina, which is more racist on average than the majority of the country. But I see your point.

> However, according to the best polls and surveys that we have, Trump attracts bigotry significantly more than other Republican candidates,

I concede this point and agree that there's no more conclusive way than this to measure this.
