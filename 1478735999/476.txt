I agree with everything you've said, but you've put forth an argument of probability, and I am not dissuaded from my belief.

Also,

> The cleanup costs of environmental disasters is enormous. It is far more fiscally responsible for a country to spend the smaller amount of money maintaining a clean environment then dealing with larger issues as they arise.

This is assuming that the will of the people demands that in the event of an environmental disaster, the government be responsible for cleaning it, which is currently true, but not actually guaranteed to stay that way. Opinions and values in populations change over time.
