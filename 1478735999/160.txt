I assume Clinton said that?  That's a weak argument.  People say stuff like, "it's my/our turn" all the time in a way that doesn't invoke some kind of line of succession.  How many times have you heard a sports team say, "it's our turn!"?  It's a common phrase and you are looking way too much into it.
