But you'll never know for sure right?

I don't believe Trump is a racist. He has never been accused of being racist until he started running for president. But even if he is, it's not illegal to be racist. But it's illegal to run a red light, or go over the speed limit. I'm sure Hilary has received at least one ticket over her lifetime. Why is it okay to support a candidate who has broken the law?

How much weight should be assigned to something which doesn't break the law? and why do you feel it should weigh more than something that does break the law?
