Saying an occasional racist / sexist joke doesn't make you racist / sexist. Or at least we have different tolerance levels of what we consider racist. You're forgetting that half of the people who voted for Trump are women. It's quite the claim to make that half the women in America are sexist.

>and still voted for him .....why?

I don't know if I speak for others, but I know people aren't perfect. Even if they appear to be. Just because Hilary hasn't been caught (aka media didnt dwell on) saying something racist or sexist, doesn't means she never has. I'm the kind of person where more information is never worse than less information. Just because because a few things someone said has been made public, doesn't mean those things were never said if not made public.
