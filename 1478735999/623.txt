> The value of a vote changes based on where you vote, and it goes up if you live in a smaller, closer state. A vote in this election was very powerful in various states. Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia. All of those states were very close and thus your vote mattered much more there. And for some of those states, polling indicated otherwise.

If you want to talk about how much a single vote *actually* mattered (as opposed to what polling what *predict*), then the value of a single vote on the rest of the country would be zero regardless of the state, since there was no state where a single vote impacted the outcome.

> If there is only a 1 - 10,000,000 chance that my vote will effect an election result that will cause something that will generate 10,000,000 times greater than my personal utility I might feel by voting for a person, then that vote is worth it.

If you think that's rational (I don't), then go ahead. Just realize that if you vote like that for your entire life, then it's essentially a certainty that your vote won't influence anything about the country. 

I mean, a similar argument of yours could be used to make it rational to vote for your 2nd best candidate in a non-swing state, but you clearly think it would be acceptable to vote for your favorite 3rd party candidate in that situation. So the intuitions for my position are already present in your mind, it seems.
