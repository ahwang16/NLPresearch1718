CMV: A HARDLINE LIBERTARIAN STANCE, WITH ENOUGH SUPPORT, COULD FORCE ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO PRIVATELY FUND ENVIRONMENTALISM.

We currently _protect_ against these sorts of claims by having a regulated system of _permitting_.  We literally permit pollution, in many regards. Thats what permits to operate from the EPA and others are! Combine this with no ownership of the sky, or with no rights to whats below and the potential for legal "harm" is mooted in a great many ways. You can't permit someone to do something and then turn around and allow them to be sued for doing so. The libertarian unwinds this - no permits that allow or disallow, no "special rights" beyond property (e.g. no mineral rights or water rights).  As a result you can claim harm to both property and do to the actual impact of the pollution .

What I don't think you need to do is demonstrate that _your_ air molecules have been stolen or polluted, just that the space you own has harmful materials in it that you don't want there, that are easily traced to a source and so on.  For water things get easier since it's on the property in a more clear way - sitting there under the ground.  If it's got some bad shit in it and you can trace it then it's much clearer that it's a property issue.

Either way the libertarian approach opens up the use of _harm_ and _property damage_ as real avenues.  How exactly that would play out is - as you point out - unknown as we've never had any real tests since we aren't operating as libertarians!
