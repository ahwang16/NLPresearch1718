> They could start by not calling us deplorables

While that particular comment may have been in bad taste, I would argue that "Deplorables" is an accurate description of the neo-nazis, white supremacists, members of the kkk, etc. that make up a not insignificant portion of Trump Supporters.

> by not making false accusations of racism

Give me an example. What "false accusations of racism"? Have you ever considered that it wasn't a false accusation?

> not using such condescending and divisive rhetoric

How does one point out racism, sexism, bigotry, and antisemitism that is displayed by Trump, many of his followers, and his proposed policies, in such away that is not "condescending and divisive rhetoric"?
