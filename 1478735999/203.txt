> The SJW crowd and Hillary "going after the banks won't end racism" miss this point even further by demonizing anyone who doesn't immediately and blindly adopt thier stances as a monster, without really trying to explain these issues from a different perspective i.e. check your privilege, mansplaining.

Except Hillary, at least her campaigning and rhetoric, were anti-WallStreet and anti-bank. In addition, the fact that being told "that was racist" is interpreted as being called a monster *is literally the problem*. The fact that we are unable to point out privilege without it being taken as calling someone a monster is the problem here, and not with democrats.
