> I would suggest engaging in open dialogue and explaining why Clinton's economic policies might be better for people than Trumps.

But that's not the issue (although I may also think that's true).  The issue at hand is that Trump said things I think are prejudiced and reprehensible, things that have caused good friends of mine to have anxiety attacks because it makes them feel so unsafe.  

You might not feel like what he said is so bad.  I think it is, and I think people who champion it or even let it pass are also doing something bad.  What I don't understand is why you find it so threatening.  Why does it set off such an extreme reaction?

 I think Trump said racist stuff.  You apparently don't.  We likely have different definitions of the word "racist."  Fine.  But dude, if you're championing dialogue, then I gotta be able to call stuff you do racist without you freakin' out and voting for Trump out of revenge.  Like... the welfare of marginalized people is important to folks like me.  You won't understand my politics unless you can hear me talk about that.  I'm not trying to shame you, I'm trying to talk about something I think was wrong.  You can listen, and then you can just disagree, if you want.

Also, yeah, sure, there is a point at which I lose patience.  White nationalists?  Deplorables.  Fuck 'em.  But similar deal: I think sometimes people aren't careful about what they say... they'll call everyone who votes for Trump irredeemable.  But, you gotta be open to the possibility that sometimes people criticize something in a way that feels threatening to you, and you think they're calling you irredeemable when they're not.
