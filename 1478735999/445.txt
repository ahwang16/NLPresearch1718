>I don't feel positive or negative towards the fact that it's a little more acceptable socially for me to be a homemaker if I choose to be than it was previously.

Context is important. There's not much respect or power enjoyed by homemakers - it's great to see it becoming more acceptable for men, but it is a pretty easy "field" to break into in terms of what it takes to earn that title. Male-dominated careers tend to be positions of power and authority that are hard to break into because of the value associated with such positions.

>So is what you're saying that, yes it's true that a lack of many women choosing to run for president is the cause of there being no female presidents, and one solution to that problem is having a female president? IE - Women would see a female president, and possibly be inspired to run for president themselves?

Exactly, especially young women and girls. I think young people look up to people they relate to and it's good for young women and girls to see women in positions of respect and authority.
