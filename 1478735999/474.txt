CMV: A HARDLINE LIBERTARIAN STANCE, WITH ENOUGH SUPPORT, COULD FORCE ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO PRIVATELY FUND ENVIRONMENTALISM.

Let's start with my assumptions:

**Humans are damaging the Earth and its atmosphere. The damage will soon be irreparable and result in the end of much life on this planet.**

**This damage is *reversible*. If enough money is invested in this cause, it's possible to "clean up" the environment and avoid a potential extinction event.**

**Environmentalists seek to fund these cleanup efforts primarily through taxes, while libertarians are persons who fundamentally oppose taxation.**

If libertarians were to be successful in securing power and removing/preventing taxation as a source of funding, environmentalists would be faced with two options:

* Pay to fix the climate problem with their own personal money, through fundraising and charity, or
* Allow the climate to suffer irreparable harm.

While the 2nd option should be equally undesirable for all groups, libertarians could leverage environmentalists' altruism to shift the very necessary cost of environmentalism from an equal burden across all taxpayers to a much heavier burden on only those who care enough to give their money freely.

**What would change my view?**

Show me that ethical altruism is prevalent enough to make the situation I've described impossible, not just unlikely. Talk about game theory. Show me variables I haven't considered. Talk about the actions of countries that are not the United States. Show me a solution allowing those persons who clean up the environment to profit from it without the money coming from taxes. Convince me that environmentalists would rather let the planet die than pay for it themselves.

**EDIT : I now believe that the burden of climate cleanup could be placed entirely on the shoulders of polluters, through criminalization and civil liabilities.**

**The existence of this alternate possibility destroys the false dichotomy I've presented and entirely prevents the worst possible outcome.**

**Thanks, bguy74.**
