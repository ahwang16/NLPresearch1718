I think most of trump voters were always going to be trump voters. many of Hillary's voters were just trying to get the lesser of 2 evils, which Bernie would have been able to secure either way because he is not trump. The majority of the criticisms of bernie you mentioned are void as trump is involved with russia and his treatment of women is more than fantasy. The only angle trump would be able to take is that Bernie is a socialist. Its unfortunate that so many americans are scared of the word because their rivalry with russia. the black and hispanic was also largely motivated by the fear that trumps racism meant for them so Bernie could well have gained it to. In an electoral system where voting is not compulsory, it is not about stealing voters, its about motivating people that wouldnt have voted to vote for you. trump had people passionate, Bernie had people passionate, Hilary had her parties regular voters and those who didn't want trump. Now Does thast mean Bernie would have won? not neccisarily, because it would have been a different electoral race, and he would have had a better shot than hilary.
