Going from zero to president is really unlikely and I definitely agree that a vote for Stein or Johnson is a waste in this political environment. What I fail to understand is why don't the Greens or the Libertarians fight for local legislatures, congress or the senate? I'd be the Greens could win a few state legislature seats on the West Coast. Yea, it's not the presidency but that's something to work from. They could create a record of change and then grow whatever momentum they get every two years. And it would be easy to do so at the midterm elections if you get a small but energized group of people out to the polls.
