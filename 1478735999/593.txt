> Dont come into this subreddit with that attitude. You need to realise that its (very) possible that you dont know what you're talking about.

You're trying to tell me that there is a *duty* to vote. It's not an attitude; there is a (very) clear distinction between a right and a duty. Voting is a right. 

> I dont think you know what it meant by being represented by your government. It means they make decisions which align with your interests.

By that logic, anyone whose interests don't align with the winning candidate (i.e. anyone who votes for the losing candidate) is not being "represented" by the government. And conversely, anyone whose interests align with the winning candidate but who did not vote *is* being represented. You're contradicting yourself. 

> It is everyones duty to vote in order to ensure a healthy democracy ... [Healthy democracy] means a democracy that isn't headed by a fucking Billionaire businessman. It means a democracy that actually serves the needs of the people and doesnt fuck over the least powerful people in society. It means a democracy where the laws are fair and allow equal opportunities for people. It means a fair society.

Same logic again, except now anyone who votes for Trump did not ensure a healthy democracy. Contradicting yourself again.
