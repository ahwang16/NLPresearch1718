Obama had a hidden tape that showed him saying some variant of the "religion is the opiate of the masses" line that *really* passed of rural religious voters who saw it. 

Obama also only made it to the Senate because the incumbent, Jack Ryan, had his sealed divorce proceedings improperly released, and everyone learned that he was a kinda creepy perv and dragged Jeri Ryan (7-of-9) to sex clubs. Jack Ryan then dropped out and a no-name rando R had to replace him. This was almost certainly the result of a shady backroom deal. 

Hillary wasn't particularly negative, personally. She also wasn't the first one to lean on her opponent's sexual history. I do think her followers were particularly vitriolic. Some, like me, are just part of the rising tide that wants to wash 1950s casual racism and sexism out to sea. But also a lot of it was people completely losing it because, for instance, they'd been abused in the same way he had abused women, or he was talking about deporting their grandma, or something else deeply maddeningly hurtful. 

I definitely need to be less of an asshole and work on reaching across divides. I did talk about her positive policy proposals some, but I should have done that more. However, Im really hesitant to criticize what I think was the particular character of this vitriolic rhetoric - hurt people expressing their hurt.
