Here's some things to think about:

All of the democrats that voted would have voted for Bernie. They are the voters that always vote and always vote democrat, whoever it is. So he has those.

MANY trump supporters were originally Bernie supporters that were either angry or still searching for the anti-candidate. So he has those swing votes.

EVEN MORE voters didn't vote because they felt disenfranchised. The amount of apathy generated by the loss of the rigged primary destroyed many young voters will to participate.

Continuing on that note, you should remember the strength and insane momentum Bernie and his supporters were building. Imagine how hard all of those people would have worked to get him elected! The excitement would have been tangible all across america. Instead, that entire machine turned off and fell apart. So the DNC didn't have that fervor on their side.

The fact is, there would have been far more enthusiasm, volunteers, and voter participation with Bernie. Also, he didn't have any scandals, and while not incredibly well know, he also wasn't disliked by anyone really, save a few assholes. It would have been a simple matter for the DNC to use their power to campaign for him.

He would have won by a landslide. Never in history has a presidential candidate been hated so much. That's why she lost. All of those numbers you quoted would have been so much different, and don't apply. Independents, republicans, and democrats alike would have instead voted Bernie.

Remember that only 50% of eligible voters voted! That's 1/3 of the population. 1/6th of the population voted trump in and decided for the rest of us!
