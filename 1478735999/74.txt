We don't know what's in Sanders past. Nobody really put him under a microscope. It's possible that the fact he never succeeded at anything but being a politician would have been played against him, or the defenses of Socialist regimes, or the fact that he's just not a quick thinker. Sanders was never a great debater, he would get visibly riled up and he mostly just stuck to his stump speech. It wouldn't be difficult for Trump to derail him. Not that it really matters, there's no evidence that debates affect the outcome of the election.

>And about the Socialist labeling, Bernie claims himself as a democratic socialist, which is very different from your old fashioned socialist.

It's actually not. Democratic socialism is typically used for a democratic government and socialist economy. It can also be used to contrast revolutionary socialism where there is a democratic instead of violent transition from capitalism to socialism. I'm not sure what Sanders personal views are but the policies he enacted are social democratic. It seems like a stupid thing to get caught up on but when you're trying to tell people "Democratic socialism isn't real socialism", you should use terms that are correct. Otherwise, your opponent just needs to point people to the actual definition to make you appear dishonest.
