One of the most important functions of stories is to allow you to experience other lives. It's a way for a human with a limited set of experiences and relationships to experience hundreds or thousands of other lives, perspectives and relationships. 

And then, having experienced in narrative form, a wider breadth of possibilities (regarding the characters, relationships, choices and consequences faced by others) we can make more informed decisions in our own lives. 

You may not realize it but your moral compass and that of everyone you know is informed largely by the stories you've experienced. 

You may never have read a book, but your worldview has still been influenced by all the books that have been read by everyone you've ever encountered or communicated with. 

Narrative is the memetic lifeline of culture. Without stories, there is no culture.
