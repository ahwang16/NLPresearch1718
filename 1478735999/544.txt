>You pivoted back to HRC for some reason.

I was trying to invalidate your argument by showing an analogy that leads to a contradiction. It's kind of how debates and arguing is done.

>They have looked at his history of not renting to black people

He has a history of not renting to poor people. All money is the same, even if a black person gives it to you.

>his instance that the Central Park 5 are guilty even after they were cleared

Why is this different from any other civilian who believes OJ Simpson is guilty even though he was cleared? Do you call everyone else racist for believing OJ was guilty?

>Or the fact that the leader of KKK says that Trump speaks for him.

You're willing to give credibility to some crazy guy in a white hat? Do you give credibility to the guys in the malls who tell you that you can be a model?
