Hillary voters would have voted for Bernie if he was up for the general. Bernie supporters would have voted for Bernie.


The fact that Hillary stole the primary from Bernie left a lot of rightfully salty Bernie supporters. Many stuck with Clinton for the general, some wrote in Bernie, some probably didn't vote, some went third, and some probably went over to Trump, would you believe.


Those votes splintering off to spite Hillary ended up costing her. Bernie performed strongly in all the weak spots of her campaign.
