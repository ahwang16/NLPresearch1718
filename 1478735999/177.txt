Obama didn't have to at the time. With that said, Obama is one of many individuals that takes shots at others. So we shouldn't use him as an example, he definitely has it in him. Clearly it calls for the right moment of when it's a legitimate method to use. It would seem, in modern history, americans get tired of one side of politics and wants to see if the other will have immediate positive results like they unrealistically promise. Because of things like healthcare and the constant attack on our rights, people kinda wanna see if republicans would fight for the same. Because of that, unlike 2008 where Obama had the advantage of not being Bush or a republican, he only had to preach "sharing the wealth" here and there or "change" there. Obama didn't have to bad mouth republicans, we were doing that for him. All he had to do was maintain momentum in the right direction.


This election, however, they needed to take shots at Trump's weakness. He is a looney, but he is also a looney that had a good chance at winning because A LOT of people didn't like what Hilary wanted to fight for. They can't win by saying "Hilary will bring change!" or "Hilary wants to share the wealth, get better taxes!" because that's not what is on people's mind right now. What is, to overly sum it up, is the healthcare act, our source of energy, our privacy from nsa or the likes, and firearms.
