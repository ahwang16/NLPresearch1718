I definitely see what you are saying. However in the Civil Rights Movement, what they were fighting against was both unconstitutional and targeted specific laws. These election protests are not attacking a specific law that can be changed. They are attacking the legally elected president. 

Perhaps if they protested against Trump's questionable actions or implemented policies in the future that would be more successful?
