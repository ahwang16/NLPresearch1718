Obama may not have said anything negative about Republicans... but he didn't need to.  There were plenty of folks in the media and the Democratic political machine denigrating and belittling conservatives in 2008 just as there are now.  

Of course, Republicans say mean things about Democrats too.  That's just how politics goes, unfortunately.
