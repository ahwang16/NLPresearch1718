Trump has been accused of racism since the 1970's when his buildings offered spaces to white people, but not blacks. Even in this decade, he's been hit with criticism of racism ever since he propagated the birther movement. During this election cycle he said a judge couldn't treat his Trump University lawsuit fairly because he was Mexican. That's textbook definition of racism. He lied about American Muslims celebrating 9/11, which is a pretty clear case of spreading lies to spread hate over a group of people. I don't think you can deny that's racism. He has committed several crimes, he has had 3,500 civil cases placed against him, he has sexually assaulted numerous women, and he committed spousal rape. He hasn't released his tax returns which is sketchy, and he urged Russia to hack into Hillary's emails, which is publicly endorsing an illegal action. Clinton has done plenty of things that border on criminal, but to say Trump hasn't is disingenuous.
