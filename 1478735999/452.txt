Trump was elected in a perfectly legal and and democratic way through the votes of millions of Americans.  We elected him, and we the people are to blame. Trump could care less about protesting. One could argue that the citizens have the constitutional right to protest, yet the people, not the government, were the ones who made this decision. Protesting against a system, laws, or tyrannical groups has proven effective. Fighting the elusive ideas of racism, sexism, and hate with marching and shouting will not work. But by discussing, teaching, and enlightening those who stand for hate and racism one on one, instead of simply marching en masse -which often leads to violence and resentment from the opposition- we will be much more successful in changing the country for the better and stopping the destruction of Democratic values and common morality.
