I am genuinely hoping my mind is changed on this. I  believe books to be as pointless a pastime as TV or equivalent. Besides non-immediate development to comprehension and overall reading ability, I don't see the point in a book, especially those fictional. Leave out nonfiction, I do understand why it is necessary to record actual information. I'm talking stories. Even classics beloved and studied into the ground, I simply don't see why they are important. They are the thoughts of the author, as simple a person as you and I. Change my view!
