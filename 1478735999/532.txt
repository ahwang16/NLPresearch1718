>I am not clear on your position. If we are talking about whether Donald Trump is a good or bad person that is something else.

Not talking about that

>I think your view that you wanted changed is that you think Trump haters make false assumptions about Trump supporters.

Correct

>Do you think that this is because they are wrong in assuming that Trump is a bad person? 

I think they are probably making these assumptions because they believe Trump is a bad person. I can't really say if they are wrong about Trump being a bad person because "bad" in this case is too subjective. Is he a bad person for wanting to enforce an existing law that you might not agree with? What if you're a shareholder? Is he a bad person for fulfilling his legal, fiduciary duty to invoke bankruptcy protection?

How many people who feel Trump is a bad person really understand the circumstances in which he made decisions that are viewed as bad? How good are their assumptions when they don't understand the context or the laws in which the actions were taken?
