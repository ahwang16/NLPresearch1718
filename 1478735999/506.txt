China is *very* threatening, then. 

The debt issue isn't quite comparable to owning your neighbor a lot of money. China invested in USA debt because, well, they thought it was a [good investment](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-18/china-s-selling-tons-of-u-s-debt-americans-couldn-t-care-less-). And as you can see, when they feel that the US debt isn't as valuable, they scale back. 

China, like Russia, seems interested in projecting its influence. The current conflicts with China have less to do with military superiority, and more to do with wanting its people to be able to use the resources of other countries however they want. That's scary, and in many places in the USA, we can see an extension of that policy in the fact that:

[In few industries is China's investment growth more apparent than real estate. A report published Sunday by the nonprofit Asia Society and the Rosen Consulting Group estimates Chinese buyers between 2010 and 2015 spent at least $93 billion on American residential property, with total expenses rising at an average annual rate of about 20 percent each year.](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-17/china-is-buying-its-way-into-the-us-economy)

Which leads us into:

>The US is a diverse free Capitalist Nation.

A fine sentiment! But China is not a diverse free *Capitalist* Nation. They engage in protectionist policies like [subsidies](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-aluminium-ahome-idUSKCN0XF2AK) (not that the USA doesn't, keep in mind) to a point where aluminum is being produced so cheaply it is not economically feasible for [USA based aluminum companies](http://www.voanews.com/a/historic-aluminum-smelting-industry-in-rapid-decline-in-us/3201868.html) to continue to produce it. And China appears to have every intent to continue operating under these policies. Policies which harm American companies just by competition in the "free market".

India has around [72% of it's population still in rural areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India) according to Wikipedia, while China has relatively recently (4 years ago) just passed [50% living in cities](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9020486/Chinas-urban-population-exceeds-rural-for-first-time-ever.html). For comparison, [80% of the US population lives in cities](https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=5971) which means that China is already out competing the USA in terms of GDP while still lagging behind in terms of infrastructure development. As fast as China is growing, it's still a long ways from being developed to the point of most Western nations, where the urban/rural ratio is about that of the USA.

CHINA'S SELLING TONS OF U.S. DEBT. AMERICANS COULDN'T CARE LESS.
For all the dire warnings over China’s retreat from U.S. government debt, there’s one simple fact that is being overlooked: American demand is as robust as ever.

CHINA IS BUYING ITS WAY INTO THE U.S. ECONOMY
The concept of "Made in America" is slowly giving way to "Made by China … in America," as Chinese investors are increasingly snatching up U.S.-based companies and assets and raising the eyebrows of some regulators and market spectators.

Since the turn of the new year, Chinese suitors have either announced interest in or closed on several multibillion dollar acquisitions of American institutions, such as General Electric's appliance wing, construction manufacturer Terex, Starwood Hotels, California-based tech company Ingram Micro and finance and production outfit Legendary Entertainment.

And although the full value of the deal has yet to be publicly unveiled, the Chicago Stock Exchange announced in February that it planned to be acquired by the China-based Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group at some point later in 2016.

"This proposed acquisition would be the first time a Chinese-owned, possibly state-influenced firm maintained direct access into the $22 trillion U.S. equity marketplace," a group of congressional representatives said in a letter to a top Treasury Department official back in February, requesting a "full and rigorous investigation into this proposed acquisition to address our concerns and provide clear information to the American people."

Chinese foreign direct investment into the U.S. hit a record $15.7 billion in 2015, up 30 percent from the year prior, according to economic analysts at the Rhodium Group. A separate Rhodium report published last month estimated 83 percent of America's congressional districts were home to some form of Chinese investment.

In few industries is China's investment growth more apparent than real estate. A report published Sunday by the nonprofit Asia Society and the Rosen Consulting Group estimates Chinese buyers between 2010 and 2015 spent at least $93 billion on American residential property, with total expenses rising at an average annual rate of about 20 percent each year.

Over that period, Chinese companies and individuals also bought up at least $17.1 billion in existing office buildings, hotels and other commercial buildings on U.S. soil. By the end of 2015, the report found, China was the source of at least $350 billion in U.S. real estate holdings and investments, and costs for Chinese-backed construction projects in the U.S. had climbed to at least $15 billion.

"Chinese direct investment in U.S. real estate was negligible until 2010 but has since grown dramatically and visibly," the report said. "While it is not as politically sensitive and does not directly impact national security as does Chinese investment in U.S. technology or telecommunications, real estate affects more people and communities and involves policymakers at multiple levels."

To be sure, foreign investment is neither specific to China nor inherently problematic. In fact, American companies' own outbound investments in 2014 to countries around the world clocked in at more than $4.9 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

It's also important to keep in mind that in the vast majority of cases, a foreign company's investment in a particular country doesn't necessarily mean one country's government is getting the upper hand over another's. If Coca-Cola invests in operations in China, for example, the U.S. government doesn't automatically carry more clout in the Chinese marketplace as a result.

But the reverse isn't necessarily true, which is what makes China's investments alarming to some American analysts. Beijing officials are heavily involved in China's private sector and have at times frozen the domestic stock market and changed other finance rules on the fly in the interest of economic self-preservation.

So when a Chinese investment group buys up, say, a major stock exchange in Chicago – or a group of investors throws billions of dollars into America's real estate sector – Beijing suddenly has an inroad to some of the gears that make the U.S. economy tick.

"The Chinese economy revolves around the artificial boosting of domestic firms," the U.S. members of Congress' February letter said. "Furthermore, government manipulation of currency in the Chinese marketplace continues to be an unresolved problem for the United States government."

So is the rapid Chinese buying spree a political ploy? Is the Chinese government trying to infiltrate America's economic bedrock through the purchase of domestic companies and real estate assets?

Not exactly, says David Dollar, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy and Global Economy and Development programs at the Brookings Institution.

"I see most of this capital outflow is commercial, not strategic or political," Dollar said last month at an event in Washington. "I don't see much strategy there. I see diversification, which is a smart strategy for a very big investor."

Dollar said the eclectic pool of U.S. investments and holdings tied to the Chinese – including New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, the national AMC Theatres cinema chain and Smithfield Foods, America's largest pork producer – isn't indicative of a coordinated political power play. Rather, he suggested Chinese companies – possibly at the behest of the Chinese government – are attempting to buy up international assets in a less volatile economy like America's.

By spreading out Chinese-owned assets, the country can better protect itself from an unexpected domestic crisis.

"A few years ago China was largely using [its assets] to invest domestically and drive its growth. But when you invest at that level, what I think inevitably happens is you get very serious problems of excess capacity. And that's what's happening in China's domestic economy now," Dollar said. "There are lots of empty apartments, enormous excess capacity in steel and other manufacturing sectors. They've overbuilt infrastructure. ... So just think of there being a lot fewer good investment opportunities in China."

And it's not as if Chinese acquisitions have been conducted unchecked; in fact, American regulators have successfully scuttled negotiations that don't even directly involve U.S. assets. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. – the specific body appealed to by the U.S. lawmakers over the Chicago Stock Exchange acquisition – earlier this year discouraged a deal that would have moved Netherlands-based Philips electronics company's LED lighting business to a Chinese investment group.

It's also important not to overlook the economic benefits foreign investment brings to the U.S. The domestic housing sector has been a major player in the country's recovery since the Great Recession, and Sunday's report from the Asia Society indicated American real estate over the last several years had been propped up by billions of dollars of Chinese investment.

And although there has been evidence in recent years of American job losses – particularly when it comes to low-skill production and manufacturing opportunities – related to the rise of China's industrial sector, Chinese foreign direct investment offers an interesting avenue to bring jobs back to the U.S. The Rhodium Group estimates more than 90,000 American employees currently work for a China-backed domestic company.

"One of the biggest challenges I had 19 years ago when I became mayor … was we had a lot of exports. But the exports were our children leaving our community because of the lack of manufacturing jobs, the lack of good jobs for our children," Sheldon Day, mayor of Thomasville, Alabama, said during a National Committee on U.S.-China Relations event in October.

Day's rural Alabama region recently became the site of Golden Dragon Precise Copper Tube Group's first U.S. plant in a move that was expected to bring hundreds of jobs while cutting down on steep transportation costs Golden Dragon would have faced if it tried to ship Chinese-made products into the U.S. marketplace.

Day said in October that the factory's opening made "a tremendous difference in our community and our economy."

AN END TO CHINESE ALUMINUM SUBSIDIES? THINK AGAIN! ANDY HOME
LONDON (Reuters) - “Today we have signed an agreement with China to eliminate export subsidies that the United States challenged because they are prohibited under WTO (World Trade Organization) rules.”

So said United States Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman in announcing last week’s deal with China to end what Froman described as a “massive and complex export subsidy program”.

One of the seven sectors covered by the agreement is “advanced materials and metals (including specialty steel, titanium and aluminum products)”, according to the USTR.

The news has raised expectations that the massive flow of Chinese semi-fabricated aluminum products into Western markets will stop.

But such high hopes are likely to be dashed because this agreement is both highly limited in nature and backward-looking.

There is no evidence that China’s broader support both for aluminum smelters and product exporters is going to be affected.

LIMITED SCOPE

The scope of last week’s agreement is narrowly defined, applying only to China’s “Demonstration Bases - Common Service Platform (CSP)” policies.

The U.S. has identified 179 so-called “demonstration bases” in China.

What exactly is a “demonstration base”? According to the USTR, it’s a specific cluster of companies which receive discounted goods and services for exports in return for meeting certain performance criteria.

The existence of such entities only became known during a previous WTO dispute with China involving automotive parts. That dispute was resolved at the consultation stage but the United States discovered that there were “demonstration bases” in many other sectors.

Last week’s agreement covers seven. As well as “advanced materials and metals” they comprise: textiles, apparel and footwear, light industry, specialty chemicals, medical products, hardware and building materials and agriculture.

The amount of subsidy involved, an alleged one billion dollars, sounds a lot until you consider it spans three years and an extremely broad spectrum of sectors.

Moreover, it should be noted that “aluminum products” only makes it third in the list of “advanced materials”, suggesting that it was peripheral within the overall framework of discussions.

Indeed, the main sectors targeted by the United States appear to be textiles and seafood production. It’s worth noting that the U.S. team working on this dispute included both the Special Textiles Negotiators’ Office and the Office of Agricultural Affairs.

BACKWARD-LOOKING

This agreement is also backward-looking.

It could only be signed and announced because China has already complied with the dismantling of the subsidy system surrounding its “demonstration bases”.

The USTR issued an appendix to its announcement detailing 175 legal instruments used in the program. All have been either terminated, amended or, in the case of annual provisions, allowed to lapse.

China’s Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Finance “have terminated all existing preferential service agreements between CSP service suppliers and local governments across the country,” according to the USTR.

Not that you’d notice from the continued flow of aluminum out of the country, a total 1,080,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year.

The figure was down 11.0 percent year-on-year but, ominously, the pace of export accelerated sharply in March.

Quite evidently, any aluminum component of the “demonstration bases” program was highly marginal relative to the bigger picture.

BIGGER PROBLEMS

That bigger picture remains the same, one of government subsidy to loss-making aluminum smelters and a trade policy that actively stimulates exports of semi-manufactured products through a VAT refund.

Ironically, Heidi Brock, president and chief executive officer of the Aluminum Association, was saying just this to the USTR one day before the deal on “demonstration bases” was announced.

Brock called for an immediate dialogue with the Chinese government to “obtain information and transparency about policies that encourage overcapacity and what the Central Government can and is doing to engage provincial and local governments to end subsidies.”

Such a dialogue must “include a discussion on China’s tax policies on aluminum exports,” namely the VAT refund afforded to exporters of semi-manufactured products, a policy that, according to Brock, has been gamed by some local operators.

Moreover, “the U.S. government should protest the Chinese government’s announced plans to stockpile primary aluminum, which serves only to prop up non-competitive smelting capacity even while new capacity in being built.”

There is nothing in the detail of last week’s agreement to suggest that anything has really changed in this bigger picture.

Or at least not when it comes to aluminum. U.S. textile and seafood production industries may see more concrete results.

POLITICS

Indeed, there may be a political sting in the tail of the deal when it comes to applying further pressure on Chinese metal exports, both of aluminum and steel products.

Because one of the other measures Brock called for in her testimony last week was for the U.S. not to grant China market economy status (MES) later this year.

In doing so, she is echoing similar lobbying on the European Commission by Europe’s steel producers, who are being crushed by the even larger export flow of steel products out of China.

In the event China is granted its much coveted market economy status, initiating trade disputes and imposing anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese products becomes more difficult.

Beijing really had no option other than to accede to dismantling the specific subsidy program surrounding “demonstration bases”.

The precedent was set in that original dispute with the United States. Having acknowledged, however tacitly, that the automotive parts “demonstration bases” contravened WTO rules, the Chinese government couldn’t very well argue that similar subsidy structures in other sectors weren’t also in breach of the same rules.

However, if by submitting to U.S. pressure on “demonstration bases” it achieves its market economy status, it will have erected a formidable political barrier to prevent more far-reaching investigation into the bigger questions surrounding its aluminum sector.

HISTORIC ALUMINUM SMELTING INDUSTRY IN RAPID DECLINE IN US
Smelter worker Chris Morales of Wenatchee, Washington, remembers the day he learned he was being laid off - via a text message on a day off. "It is a feeling of surprise, panic," he said. "Now what? My wife has a good job; I'm fortunate for that. But still, I was counting on Alcoa, which has been around for years."

Sixty-four years here in Wenatchee, in fact. The American company now known as Alcoa was the first to commercialize aluminum production more than 100 years ago. That industry eventually employed tens of thousands of workers around the US. But aluminum smelting is now in steep decline domestically, and while Alcoa insists it will still make aluminum in the Pacific Northwest, many laid-off workers, like Morales, have doubts. He recalled the advice he got from plant managers: "something along the lines of, 'You need to go find another job.'"

So he is moving on, hoping service as a volunteer firefighter will turn into a career position.

Hundreds of jobs lost

The idling of the Alcoa Wenatchee smelter at the beginning of January cost around 420 jobs, which paid around double the average wage of that area. Another 465 workers at another Alcoa smelter outside Ferndale, Washington, are worried.

Plant manager Barry Hullett explained the situation at a hearing before state Senators. "It is important to notice the difference between a curtailment and a closure. When we curtail a plant, we keep it in operating condition so it may be restarted. That's different than a closure." He noted that what the remaining Pacific Northwest smelters face is indefinite curtailment.

Hullett hopes market conditions "will change for the better." But the price for aluminum fell around 30 percent last year. "The metal price shouldn't stay at this level," he said. "It's at historic lows. So commodity cycles should change. Hopefully when that does, we'll be positioned to keep operations going in Washington state."

Growing international competition

Fifteen years ago, there were 23 active aluminum smelters in the U.S. Today there are only six - including that one in Ferndale - and by mid-year, there could be fewer after scheduled closures.

Karen McBeth follows aluminum's fortunes for the industry news service Platts. She says U.S. firms face tough competition from newer smelters in China and other countries."It's interesting how China has just completely overtaken the industry," she said. "It is true of a lot of metals markets, not just aluminum. They now account for about half of global production and half of global demand. So they are a huge factor."

McBeth is rooting for a U.S. comeback, but not counting on it. "At the moment though, a number of these smelters are being dismantled. It is going to be a little late for the U.S. industry to try to make a comeback if the price doesn't improve soon."

She notes that aluminum production is very energy intensive, so any revival might also require favorable power deals. New York State just reached a subsidy deal to keep the northeast's only remaining smelter in operation for three more years.

Back in Washington state, longtime smelter worker Kelley Woodard says losing metal production hurts U.S. strategic interests.

"I'm not a big fan of government supplying a lot of money to corporations," he admitted. "But I, as a citizen, think it is vital to keep some type of aluminum production in the U.S. I am hoping, hoping a lot, that the Northwest can maybe keep a couple smelters around."

The Chicago-based Century Aluminum Company and the United Steelworkers Union are lobbying for trade sanctions against Chinese aluminum exports. The U.S. Labor Department approved special retraining and dislocated worker benefits recently, agreeing that American aluminum industry workers have been harmed by foreign trade.



What are they doing now?

Clayton Verellen, age 33

Alcoa Wenatchee smelter worker for five years, pot tender

Family: Married with two kids, ages 8 and 1.

“I liked being a pot tender,” Verellen said about his job in the heart of the smelter. He had ownership over a section and could see the fruits of his work. “If you did good, you saw the benefits right away. If you did bad, you saw the consequences generally right away too.”

What next: Verellen is coaching his son’s ski racing team this winter and reconnecting with family, before going back to school in spring for a course of study to be determined.

Chris Morales, age 39

Alcoa Wenatchee smelter worker for five years, mostly fixing furnaces.

Family: Married with three little girls.

"The job is far from glamorous," said Morales. He will miss the camaraderie. "What I enjoyed was the relationship I built with my crewmembers. You learn to rely on people to get work done."

What next: Hoping to be hired as a career firefighter in Douglas County after serving many years as a volunteer with a county fire district.

Kirk Peterson, age 46

Alcoa Wenatchee smelter worker for 18 years, electrician.

Family: Divorced, two young kids.

"I loved what I did," said Peterson about his time at the smelter. "It wasn't a total shock," to learn the plant would be idled. "We had heard that we were losing three, four or five million dollars a month. We all kind of thought in the back of our minds that at some point they got to cut the bleeding," Peterson recalled. "It was still a surreal feeling."

What next: Peterson's electrician skills are transferable, but he is not thrilled about the likely need to travel to far-flung job sites.

Kelley Woodard, age 56

Alcoa Wenatchee smelter worker for 32½ years, equipment operator

President, Wenatchee Aluminum Trades Council.

Family: Married with one son in college and one other grown son

"I've seen it all, been there a long time," said Woodard. This is turning out differently than past down cycles, though. "We would have our low times. We'd curtail, but then it wouldn't be as bad as what everybody predicted and we would come back. So I was having hope that somehow this would be like that. It would be rough, but we would get through it somehow."

What next: Woodard still reports to work as part of a skeleton crew that monitors and maintains vital systems at the Wenatchee smelter. He does not know how long this unexpected extension in his job will last, but hopes to get "at least one more year" in before taking retirement.

India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world's population. According to the 2017 revision of the World Population Prospects[1], the population stood at 1,324,171,354.

During 1975–2010 the population doubled to 1.2 billion. The Indian population reached the billion mark in 1998. India is projected to be the world's most populous country by 2022,[4] surpassing the population of China. It is expected to become the first political entity in history to be home to more than 1.5 billion people by 2030, and its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050.[5][6] Its population growth rate is 1.2%, ranking 94th in the world in 2013.[7]

India has more than 50% of its population below the age of 25 and more than 65% below the age of 35. It is expected that, in 2020, the average age of an Indian will be 29 years, compared to 37 for China and 48 for Japan; and, by 2030, India's dependency ratio should be just over 0.4.[8]

India has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[9] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates (the Nihali language[10] spoken in parts of Maharashtra and the Burushaski language spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir (Kashmir).

Further complexity is lent by the great variation that occurs across this population on social parameters such as income and education. Only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[11]

The sex ratio is 944 females for 1000 males (2016).[12]

History [ edit ]

Prehistory to early 19th century [ edit ]

The following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820. It includes estimates and growth rates according to five different economic historians, along with interpolated estimates and overall aggregate averages derived from their estimates.

The population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[21] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[13][15] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[13][15]

India's population growth rate under the Mughal Empire (16th–18th centuries) was higher than during any previous period in Indian history.[21][22][15] Under the Mughal Empire, India experienced an unprecedented economic and demographic upsurge,[21] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production,[23] proto-industrialization[24] that established India as the most important center of manufacturing in international trade,[25] and a relatively high degree of urbanization for its time;[26] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[26] and contemporary Europe[26] up until the 19th century.[27]

Under the reign of Akbar the Great (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[28] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[29] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[26] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[26] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[30] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[31] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707).[28]

Late 19th century to early 20th century [ edit ]

The population of India under the British Raj (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) according to censuses:

Studies of India's population since 1881 have focused on such topics as total population, birth and death rates, growth rates, geographic distribution, literacy, the rural and urban divide, cities of a million, and the three cities with populations over eight million: Delhi, Greater Mumbai (Bombay), and Kolkata (Calcutta).[35]

Mortality rates fell in the period 1920–45, primarily due to biological immunisation. Other factors included rising incomes, better living conditions, improved nutrition, a safer and cleaner environment, and better official health policies and medical care.[36]

Salient features [ edit ]



(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average) Infant mortality rate trends in India(per 1000 births, under age 1, national average)

India occupies 2.41% of the world's land area but supports over 18% of the world's population. At the 2001 census 72.2% of the population[40] lived in about 638,000 villages[41] and the remaining 27.8%[40] lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations.[42]

India's population exceeded that of the entire continent of Africa by 200 million people in 2010.[43] However, because Africa's population growth is nearly double that of India, it is expected to surpass both China and India by 2025.

[63] The data suggests the existence of high sex ratios before and after the arrival of ultrasound-based prenatal care and sex screening technologies in India. Male to female sex ratio for India, based on its official census data, from 1941 through 2011.The data suggests the existence of high sex ratios before and after the arrival of ultrasound-based prenatal care and sex screening technologies in India.

The table below represents the infant mortality rate trends in India, based on sex, over the last 15 years. In the urban areas of India, average male infant mortality rates are slightly higher than average female infant mortality rates.[64]

Some activists believe India's 2011 census shows a serious decline in the number of girls under the age of seven – activists fear eight million female fetuses may have been aborted between 2001 and 2011.[67] These claims are controversial. Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be because of natural factors, such as the age of mother at baby's birth, age of father at baby's birth, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, etc.[68] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to 870–930 girls to 1000 boys birth sex ratios observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios below 900 girls to 1000 boys observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[69][70]

In India, there are 1,652 languages and dialects in total.[99][100]

Population projections [ edit ]

India is projected to overtake China as the world's most populous nation by 2030. India's population growth has raised concerns that it would lead to widespread unemployment and political instability.[101][102] Note that these projections make assumptions about future fertility and death rates which may not turn out to be correct in the event. Fertility rates also vary from region to region, with some higher than the national average and some lower.

Ethnic groups [ edit ]

The national Census of India does not recognise racial or ethnic groups within India,[105] but recognises many of the tribal groups as Scheduled Castes and Tribes (see list of Scheduled Tribes in India).

According to a 2009 study published by Reich et al., the modern Indian population is composed of two genetically divergent and heterogeneous populations which mixed in ancient times (about 1,200–3,500 BC), known as Ancestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians (ASI). ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[106][107]

Genetics [ edit ]

Y-chromosome DNA [ edit ]

[110]

Y-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[111]

H ~ 30%

R1a ~ 34%

R2 ~ 15%

L ~ 10%

NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)

Other Haplogroups 15%

Mitochondrial DNA [ edit ]

[112]

Mitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[113]

Autosomal DNA [ edit ]

Numerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.

In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder et al . have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that "(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now ; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities." [114]

In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins et al ., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia. [115] [116]

., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia. Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins et al . to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data shows historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.

. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data shows historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations. In 2006, Sahoo et al . reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.

The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[115]

CHINA'S URBAN POPULATION EXCEEDS RURAL FOR FIRST TIME EVER
Just over 680 million now live in cities – 51.27 per cent of China's entire population of nearly 1.35 billion.

Most have moved during two decades of boom in search of economic opportunities, and the historic mass migration from fields to office and apartment blocks ends the country's centuries-long agrarian status.

But the rapid modernisation and demand for improved living standards is piling extra pressure on society and the already blighted environment, experts claim.

With 75 per cent of Chinese expected to be living in cities within 20 years, the demand for more transport, energy, water and other vital infrastructure is set to test resources and city planners.

"Urbanisation is an irreversible process ... It will have a huge impact on China's environment, and on social and economic development," Li Jianmin, head of the Institute of Population and Development Research at Nankai University told reporters.

In the 12 months from December 2010 to December 2011, a further 21 million arrived in cities – more than the population of Sri Lanka – while rural inhabitants dropped, the statistics show.

Many of those settling down in urban areas are migrant workers – people moving from the country to cities to seek economic empowerment.

This transient population of cheap labour, put at nearly 221 million by a national census last April, helped turn China into the world's second-largest economy in just three decades.

Months following the consensus, another government report said more than 100 million farmers would move to cities by 2020.

The influx is seen as having a destabilising effect on urban society, according to experts.

Government policy has failed to keep up with what some observers call the economic and social reality.

Most migrant workers are treated as lower-class citizens in their adopted towns or cities because they are still classified as rural residents under the controversial – and to many, outdated – Hukou household registration system.

The Hukou is the registration paper or residency permit which ties a migrant worker to his or her home town. This means they can only receive benefits back in their home town, and not in the cities where they go for work.

This means they have little or no social security, including access to education for their children, health and other welfare provisions.

However, expectations are growing – especially among young migrant workers who are demanding higher wagers and living standards similar to their middle class neighbours.

Worryingly for Beijing, this perceived urban apartheid is a main source of social unrest.

Also fanning discontent is what some view as a vicious circle drawn by flawed government planning, official corruption and lack of social justice because of a questionable legal system.

Many migrant workers are forced to settle in the cities because their farms have been sold off during land grabs to make way for more urbanisation.

Peng Xizhe, Professor of Demography at Fudan University, told The Daily Telegraph opinion is divided over whether to expand existing big cities or build new, smaller urban zones.

"We've been arguing for three decades about how best to implement urbanisation. In the years ahead, intelligent, smaller scale city planning will be crucial to better manage resources," he said.

"The government also realises this is important if it is to avoid polarisation among residents," he added.

Gridlocked Beijing and Shanghai, which have a combined population of over 45 million, are planning to contain the increase of their populations.

But policy is inconsistent, with other metropolises encouraging migration.

Official figures show the rate of urbanisation has gathered pace over the past decades.

Only one in five people lived in cities in 1982.

By 1990, urban dwellers represented 26 per cent of the total population – a figure that rose to 36 per cent in 2000 and jumped faster over the next decade to reach 51.27 per cent.
