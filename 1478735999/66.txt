I'm not saying it would be a blowout. You have to admit that the rust belt is the area that Bernie would have most outperformed Hillary regardless of whether it would be enough to win. 

When you look at the margins there, there are plenty of areas that have been blue since Bill that went red in 2016. Then you have to ask what made them switch? Did the population drastically change since then? I believe that all it would take to have kept them blue was a candidate that addressed the main issue those voters had and that was saying "fuck you"  to the elites.

I'm not really sure why you thought Bloomberg would run 3rs party. Everyone realizes 3rd party candidates can't win and Bloomberg would realize that too. The Hillary voters who feared trump would have still feared trump. The main problem Hillary voters had with Bernie was his lack of pragmatism not his ideas in general.

 I guess it's possible Bloomberg would have run, but he could have taken some from trump too so that just makes things to murky to forecast in my opinion.
