I think a huge problem is that the economic hardships facing millions of people is framed as white privilege when in reality its class privilege that is worsened by white privilege. Sure there are many instances where white privilege is a thing (ie interactions with police) and some of those instances definitely contribute to how much money is in your bank account but economics-wise, what is perceived as white privilege generally would be better described and talked about /framed as class privilege with contributions from racial issues. The fact that people are discussing white privilege is important for many social issues so dont get me wrong but when speaking about the economic direction we want to take this country and the economic health of its electorate, it should not be framed as a race issue which in my mind needlessly divides people and doesnt go to the real root of the problem (i.e the economic policies). I understand talking about how race plays into it but i think when people want to talk about white privilege there should be the caveat of this system is hurting the lower/middle class no matter what race you are and any race issues only contribute to that.

Again, these two issues - race/class privilege - are extremely intertwined but i think we've gotten to a point in this country where it is more a class issue then a race one.
