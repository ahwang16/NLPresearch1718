I'm a history teacher. 

And I have to tell my 6th graders the spiel on how America is about freedom and we have been working to make sure that everyone was on the same page. 

And then I look at the list of presidents and I see 44.5 white faces looking at me and I see no women. 

And I find that odd. 

I don't see a real reason for why every single American woman has been excluded from the highest office. That we still have people in 2016 who state in forums that they aren't ready for a woman president. 

There really is not any reason for why we haven't had a female president yet...unless we still have a struggle with sexist thoughts.
