Just to make sure, and because I would basically just repeat what I think you mean if I responded to OP.

Don't vote for a 3rd party for the presidential election because that is the same as not voting for your least favorite option's opponent.

Do seek out and vote for 3rd party for local and maybe even state elections because that is how smaller groups can implement larger change, while also having an actual shot at winning.
