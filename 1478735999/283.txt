But they are, obviously, spiteful by default. How do you even start to pander to people which consider "revenge" some kind of political advantage to be gained ? They're willing to vote themselves into an uncertain situation that promise them nothing, for the only tangible benefit of "sticking it to the man". Just look at this thread and see OP literally bend over backward to justify everything and anything his candidate might say or do. He's willing to ignore or sweep away *anything* Trump (or supporters) might've said or done, to perform miracles of mental gymnastics, but is pushed into a vicious rage by the opposition calling Trump supporter's "deplorable" or portraying the man himself as "racist". How are you to pander to these people ? You pretend racism doesn't exist ? That women face no particular challenges ? That LGBT rights are a non-issue ? 

Then, the cherry on top, the very notion that they were "pushed" into supporting Trump is the most patronizing argument possible.
