Trump got less votes than Romney in 2012, clinton got way less votes than Obama in 2012.  Clintons message of "Donald is bad" didn't inspire anyone to go and vote.  This lead to a huge collapse in her base. Also ignoring several of the state's she assumed she would win ie Wisconsin Pennsylvania, helped deflate turnout. 

Tldr voting participation was way down esp for dems.
