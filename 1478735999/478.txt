Oh, I'm sorry, it was my understanding that your argument went something like:

It's in everyone's best interest to clean the planet, and most people know this, therefore the probability that a democratic government would opt to do otherwise is low.

I see now that you're making an argument of economic efficiency, saying it's in the government's best economic interest to fight pollution as opposed to letting it fester, but a premise of my argument is that taxes are now gone, and the government essentially has no extra money to choose to spend on things like this.
