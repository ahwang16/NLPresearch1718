How about calling people cucks for disagreeing? How about implying that the only reason someone might support another candidate could be that they're a paid shill? Are those things you would do? 

Or did you forget that those were a major thing (and still are)?

Everybody needs to be an adult right now, and willfully ignoring an entire side of the bills from this past year isn't helping.
