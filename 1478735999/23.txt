Trump didn't win because he did better than past candidates. 

The data shows he preformed similar to Romney. 

The problem was clinton drastically under preformed. She failed to inspire people to vote for her with enthusiasm. Her campaign and the dnc failed to reach out to voters and create that enthusiasm. 

Bernie's campaign did create that enthusiasm as we saw with the rallies and his swing from unknown to challenging her position. Additionally a lot of people voted for trump because he was anti-establishment. With Bernie running against trump your have those anti establishment votes splitting between the candidates.

An additional problem clinton had was her fakeness and lack of charm. Bill, trump, obama, bernie all have that air of sincerity about them.
