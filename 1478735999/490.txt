OK, I believe you that if libertarians came to power, they would value their rights to keep their property un-polluted over the rights of others to use their property for the purposes of pollution.

Climate cleanup doesn't have to be funded by taxes, it can be funded by the establishment of civil liabilities and the criminalization of pollution.

I hadn't considered that the burden of environmentalism could be put entirely on the shoulders of polluters.
