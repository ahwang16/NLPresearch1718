In a historic ruling on August 12, 2013, following a nine-week trial, a federal judge found the New York City Police Department liable for a pattern and practice of racial profiling and unconstitutional stops.

The lawyers arguing against stop and frisk did make arguments based on the 4th and 14th Amendments.  They were making stops based on total lack of suspicion other than race which was a clear violation of the 4th Amendment.  

And Sharia law isn't legal in the US. No one is getting stoned in the US based on Sharia law.  Most Syrian refugees are kids and mothers who are escaping a war zone.
