CMV: A HARDLINE LIBERTARIAN STANCE, WITH ENOUGH SUPPORT, COULD FORCE ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO PRIVATELY FUND ENVIRONMENTALISM.

I'm going to pull and end-around here to your framing of the situation. I don't like the decision box you've put us in!  The far more likely mechanism is of change is baed on that of the combination of criminal and financial  _accountability_ combined with the libertarian idea of very strong ideas of private property that extend to the air above and water below owned land.  This will allow individuals to _sue_ corporations and hold them financially (and maybe criminally) responsible for damage to their property..their air and water.  So...I could sue the gas company for the pollution to the air above my house.

From where we are today, this seems far more plausible than that altruism you're looking for, and also more likely than the runaway harm because....we fucking LOVE to sue people.
