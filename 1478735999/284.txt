> The only thing that contributed to Trump's victory is the people that made the conscious choice to vote him in. This here is more than a simple affirmation that "pandering to people make them vote for you". It's laying the responsibility for the election at the feet of the opposing side and saying "here, look what you did".

Are you suggesting that nothing liberals say or do effects the way moderates and conservatives vote? Because that is  an unbelievable claim.
