Can you explain to me why you think racial and gender barriers are analogous?

>Is there a shortage of female role models? In addition, I think that many of the people who would have seen Clinton as a role model probably wouldn't have felt the same way about Palin, or Fiorina. Being a role model to someone (as president) has more to do with their politics than their gender.

A role model in the sense of "a woman can be a president too." That shit is inspiring, and inspiration has objective utility in that it motivates people and increases mood.
