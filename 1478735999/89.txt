Your last 3 sources aren't arguing anything. The first two are literally proving my point, I acknowledge the fact that clinton had low minority turnout. You never gave any reasons why Sanders would have higher minority turnout than her when he failed to do so in the primary. 

Scandals definitely caused a dip in Trump support among some demographics, just not enough to compensate for his support among white males. You also don't give any reason why Sanders would be immune to scandal the way Trump is, since they're very different candidates. Trump never ran a clean campaign, but Bernie basically ran on a purity test. 

Lol idk why your tone is so angry.
