>and calling Trump racist. 

If liberals aren't allowed to call someone racist when they say that a judge can't do their job because of their ethnicity, when can they?

Shaming racism has been generally effective, even racists don't think they like racism anymore. Why are you so sure it's suddenly working backwards? If Trump got his base riled up with hate and the Democrats just sat back saying "hey we don't love that but whatever you want I guess, don't want to hurt your feelings" do you think Clinton would have won?
