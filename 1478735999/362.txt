I supported both Bernie and Hillary in the primaries, and voted for Hillary in the general election, but I've been reading so much on Facebook and seeing on the news so many people who argue that Trump's win is indicative of the racism, sexism, and xenophobia in our society and by and large I just don't buy it. I believe that the vast majority of Trump supporters voted for him because they are working class and tired of feeling cheated by their government. 

The rural working class have had to sit back and watch their jobs disappear and their towns face severe economic troubles and often destruction for the last three decades at least. They see the news media and liberal pundits as dismissive of their plight at best, and hostile towards their way of life at worst, and aren't unreasonable for thinking that way. Their vote was largely a reaction to a country that does not seem to take them seriously, and that's a perfectly legitimate reason to vote for someone.
