That entirely depends on your life.

If you derive joy from reading fiction, it's entirely possible that your reading makes you more efficient/productive if you take breaks for reading fiction over the course of a day.

If you plan on being a writer, reading other works inspires you, and expands your "toolkit".

There are certain kinds of humor and other life-enriching things that only work in the written word. Take this paraphrasing of a Douglas Adams quote for instance.

"Nothing happened.

After a few seconds, nothing continued to happen."

It might not be the funniest joke, but it usually gets a chuckle, but that's something that doesn't work in any other media than the written word. This and other examples are simply how some descriptive text is written in his books, rather than a typical "joke".

If you do anything creative, then reading and taking in media is an important part of that, for aforementioned reasons. Knowing what you like to read (or watch or listen to or play) informs decisions about the things you will create.
