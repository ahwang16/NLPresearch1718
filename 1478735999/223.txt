I am not for crushing anyone into the dirt but it cannot happen without calling it wrong and the people wrong for doing it. If someone is ashamed to be called wrong, they should not do wrong. If someone is angered when their marginalization of others is called out, they are not going to be for social justice, period. I just don't believe those people can be won over, except once the tide has fully turned against them. 

I wish there were no need for a fight at all, but I do not see antagonism. I see people saying what is right and what is wrong. (And a few, I hope not the ones who made the difference in this election, and I don't believe they are -- I believe it was issues like economics and guns and an unlikable candidate --, a few who say "Fuck that, I wasn't marginalizing anyone" right as they go along and continue to do so, or worse yet explain why those people deserve marginalization.) 

Now, if we're talking about passive racism/sexism/xenophobia, I agree with your strategy of empathy and discussion. And I think it's been used. But some things cannot be addressed with a "Why do you feel that way?" Some things are just too nasty.
