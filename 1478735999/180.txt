The problem is that Trump is a truly horrific candidate who said some absolutely abominable things. I mean, complete gutter talk, mistreatment of women, discrimination against black people, demonization of brown people... Some really ugly, ugly shit.

So when liberals see people rallying behind the guy saying that ugly shit, we have to wonder what the hell is wrong with them. We figure, yeah, they may be upset about the economy, but how is that a justification for sanctioning that kind of talk? Sure, they may feel disenfranchised, but how is that reason to ignore the unacceptability of the rhetoric.

The gleefulness with which Trump supporters wore their "Trump That Bitch" and other hateful messages contributes as well. The protests of non-racists and non-misogynists who say "I voted for Trump in spite of that talk, not because of it" ring hollow.

We expected the American public to stand with us against racism and misogyny, and were sorely disappointed.
