>his buildings offered spaces to white people, but not blacks

I'm well aware of the article. But you might not be aware that Trump was not sued. His company was sued. It's an important distinction. Companies get sued every day for all sorts of baseless and unreasonable things by people trying to get money. McDonalds was sued for making kids fat. McDonalds was sued for targeting black people. Microsoft was sued for 100 dollars by some guy who knew Microsoft would not spend the $1000 per hour lawyer fee to fight him.

Also, his buildings were offered to people who could afford it. It's not racist just because the ones who could pay were white.

>During this election cycle he said a judge couldn't treat his Trump University lawsuit fairly because he was Mexican

You might want to look more into this. There was a huge conflict of interest and he definitely should not have been assigned onto the case.

>He lied about American Muslims celebrating 9/11

You realize this actually happens right? Not every Muslim, but there are few out there.
