Sure, and I do not deny that he had some questionable business practices as a investor. However, that does not mean that he hates minorities or anything, just that he is willing to discriminate for the sake of business. 

A better argument here would be that Trump is a unethical businessman, or that he does not have the civility to be an effective president. Both of those are valid arguments and do not insult the intelligence of his supporters.
