>It's only counterproductive if it results in a net loss in votes. Sure, their tactics pissed off some moderates, but they did manage to fire up their base. 

Sure, I can totally get how this is a valid strategy for raising morale and rallying liberal voters. However, I think that can be done in other ways. 

Obama was never condescending and rude in 2008. His message was about positive change and unity, not about demeaning people and saying "never McCain". If I recall correctly, he got a great voter turnout.
