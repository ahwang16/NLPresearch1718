Sorry but that's completely wrong. The government absolutely represents you even if you didn't vote. It's not like you're automatically opted out of programs and legislation because you didn't cast a ballot. 

It is *not* a duty to vote. It's a right. 

I don't understand what you mean by healthy democracy. Democracy is about choice and everyone has the choice to vote or not vote. A democracy is healthy as long as everyone holds that right; exercising that right has nothing to do with it.
