I'm a progressive (well to the left of the Democrat party), and I've gathered the same. It's actually very infuriating, because I strongly suspect that Trump wouldn't be president now if most of my fellow progressives would learn some basic human psychology. A lot of people I know are going to suffer terribly for this, for no fault of their own.

There's a good reason that politicians generally utilize "politically correct" language. It's language that's intended to reduce offense; a lot of words have offensive connotations in certain spheres, and insults and alienation does *real* harm to people's psyches. You'd think more people on the left would understand this, but I think the left has a lot of newcomers who may have switched policy preferences, yet haven't actually embraced the tenets of social progress that normally inform those political preferences.

It's been surreal seeing so many self-proclaimed progressives using maximally aggressive rhetoric against those different to themselves, while so many self-proclaimed conservatives ask for a more moderate and open-minded tone. Politics is all mixed up--whatever political "side" people align themselves with seems increasingly unrelated to their actual ideology--and I think we may be on the verge of a major reshuffling of parties and voting blocs.
