Must've missed this in 2012 then. Republicans, Romney and Ryan included, were going around saying that Obama believes that "if you've got a business, you didn't build that," which was so obviously and egregiously a misquoting of what he said that it was both intellectually dishonest and disgusting that they'd participate in such an outrageous lie. It is at least plausible to say that Hillary called half of his supporters deplorables, and half of a pretty big group is still a pretty big group.
