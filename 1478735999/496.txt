Your main assumption is that I'd rather shovel water and live than not 


Libertarian environmental policies, small sample size as it is, shows no evidence of that. 


What I meant by 'your own definition' is that you're making libertarians *into* environmentalists by assuming they would do anything. It seems that they want to defund the epa and repeal statutes that protect water and air by limiting pollution , both of which are very much a "you do it or we both drown" attitude to me. 

Is there something you could point me to thay illustrates libertarian philosophy on this matter?
