This isn't a legal issue. Just because there's no reasonable expectation or right doesn't mean that criticism is acceptable.  

I don't have a reasonable expectation or right to stay dry while walking down the sidewalk, but that doesn't mean you should intentionally veer your car into a puddle in order to splash me.
