You pivoted back to HRC for some reason. 

She doesn't matter any more. Trump does. 

People haven't called Trump racist because the wanted to smear him. 

They have looked at his history of not renting to black people, or his instance that the Central Park 5 are guilty even after they were cleared. Or comments that Trump made that the speaker of the house called "fundamentally racist." Or the fact that the leader of KKK says that Trump speaks for him. 

So instead of deflecting to Clinton and speeding tickets let's stay focused on why so many people are concerned that Trump is either racist or that feel that racist have a place in the Trump tent.
