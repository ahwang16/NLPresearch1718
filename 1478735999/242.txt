That claim requires that 1. Not liking Donald Trump's wall is a conflict of interest, as well as assuming that 2. All Americans of Mexican decent don't like Donald Trump's wall. 2 is a broad generalization about a diverse group of people based solely on ethnicity/race. Nothing indicates he would handle the case any worse than any other judge who thinks Donald Trump's wall is a horrible idea. 

The alternate assumption if 1 is untenable is that there is something different about being Mexican that makes him unable to professionally work with Donald Trump, which is also an assumption about Mexicans 

Both of these ways
