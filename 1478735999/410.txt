>Yeah, I actually think this in the strict definition sense in that they are comparable in certain respects. In this case, I think the impact of a female president to gender relations is comparable to the impact of a black president to race relations (very little, if anything positive)

But women are 50% of the population and racial minorities by definition are not. It stands to reason that if everyone were equal, approximately 50% of presidents would be female, but that is not the case. Having a female president would be an indicator that the cultural and historical barriers that have prevented that statistic from being equal are weakened to a degree that is motivating and mood-improving for Americans who place importance on that sort of thing.

>But how is that not already true? Of course a woman can be president.

I'm talking about from the perspective of a child.

>I might be able to accept that this is true, but why is motivating woman more important than motivating other groups?

Because, again, women are 50% of the population but 0% of presidents.
