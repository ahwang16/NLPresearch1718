It seems many are worried China will overtake The United States soon as a World Power, or at least economically. It's clear they have a ton of production and trade, and The US is in a lot of debt to them.

I see that at the moment that China seems to have the economic upper hand. However, I believe there are two issues for China that prevent them from overtaking The US.

1. The military power of The US is humongous compared to that of China. I see it as being similar to two second graders. The bigger kid can ask the smaller kid for money all he wants, and even demand it, because of his size. The smaller kid has practically no choice in the matter no matter how much "debt" the bigger kid accumulates.

2. The US is a diverse free Capitalist Nation. I believe that the mixing of various cultures and the encouragement of entrepreneurship is a breeding ground for sell-able ideas. I once heard a quote I thought hits this problem on the head. I'm not sure who exactly said it, (If you could help me out with the source it would be much appreciated) "We have kung-fu and we have pandas, but we could not make a film like Kung-fu Panda."

Anyways, I'm no economist or political expert, please don't crucify me for any lack of knowledge.
