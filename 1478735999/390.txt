Sorry, but this is an opinion, not facts. There are a lot of things that go into working class people voting for who they think will support them. The Dems are pro EPA and big government, for example, which arguably causes factories and power plants to shut down and leave small towns, taking the town's livelihood with them.

And actually Hillary's alleged ties with Wall Street make the working class voters trust her even less.
