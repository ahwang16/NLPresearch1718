I could make that exact same argument for black people.

"But black people are 15% of the population. It stands to reason that if everyone were equal, approximately 15% of presidents would be black, but that is not the case. Having a black president would be an indicator that the cultural and historical barriers that have prevented that statistic from being equal are weakened to a degree that is motivating and mood-improving for Americans who place importance on that sort of thing."
