Trumps economic plan is slash taxes and entitlements. Bernies was to bloat taxes and entitlements. Most economic conservatives and moderates are more wary of the latter than the former. And all Trump has to do is sell the uneducated populace (who he was able to convince that Hillary would be indicted, that 12 women were lying about sexual assault, and that Mexico will actually pay for the wall) on the idea that the raised taxes won't be worth it. Bernie may have facts on his side, but so did Hillary and half the country doesn't believe in facts. They would hear "raise taxes" and that would be where it starts and ends for Bernie.

I also don't think that all the primary Hillary supporters would have moved over to Bernie. There's a great deal of "establishment" behind her that wouldn't support a populist who wants such high taxes. There's a great deal of blue collar working class moderates who would have stayed home.

Not to mention third party bids. Michael Bloomberg said he'd run if it was Bernie vs. Trump and he'd take a lot of the voters from both parties who trust the establishment still and voted for Hillary, Rubio, Jeb, Kasich, and Cruz. And even if he didn't run, in light of all of Trumps scandals, I think fewer republicans would have abandoned him if the alternative was someone so diametrically opposed to GOP policy.
