> A female president would prove that those barriers have broken down, and show that women in this country really can do anything

I don't agree. I think it'd be pretty hard to find many black people who feel ethnic barriers have been broken down since Obama was elected.

>  a female president would serve as a role model

Is there a shortage of female role models? In addition, I think that many of the people who would have seen Clinton as a role model probably wouldn't have felt the same way about Palin, or Fiorina. Being a role model to someone (as president) has more to do with their politics than their gender.
