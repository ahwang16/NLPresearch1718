>  Many of the posts deal with talk of women, people of color, etc. so fearful that they're thinking of Republicans that they're thinking of leaving the country. 

i mean, can't you understand them a little? it's a long standing pattern that these groups get the shit end of the stick when republicans are in power, and Trump basically rode to victory on a platform of bringing out the worst the GOP has to offer and celebrating it.

if i were a woman or a minority i would be worried too.
