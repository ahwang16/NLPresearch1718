There was a study that found people who read literary fiction are more empathetic than others and are more likely to correctly guess what others are thinking.

Books provide a unique medium in which we get to hear the inner thoughts of another person. On TV you'd only get this with constant voice overs for the characters, but with books it's natural and unobtrusive. Even when the characters are completely fictitious, we still get the exercise of hearing inside someone's head, and that trains us to think more about what the real people in our lives are thinking.
