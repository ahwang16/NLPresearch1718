It has, and it's terrible.

Supporters of both candidates fail to understand that the other side isn't generally stupid or misinformed, they just weigh their issues differently and approach them from another angle.

Or, to answer more directly to your OP post: Not all Trump voters want to restore 1950s social values. Some voted for him because he's put more emphasis on safety from terror and crime, others feel mocked by Clinton stating that the economy is recovering while they don't feel any effect of that. Many gun owners see him as the only alternative to more widespread bans.

In either case, your premise assumes they will support him even if he goes against their main matter of concern. Some may, but it would be far from the majority.
