Even if HRC ran as Vice President, which I can totally see happen, what would HRC actually help Bernie with? I guess she might weaken Bloomberg, but is HRC really enough to, idk, stop Bloomberg from getting *any* blue-leaning state? Remember, even if Bernie theoretically beats Trump, Trump still wins if nobody gets over 270. 

Plus, HRC as VP might discourage the Sanders base. 

>  the states Bernie pulled in the primary were states that Hillary was relying on most crucially to win the electoral college. States such as Wisconsin, Michigan, New Hampshire, and the central West Virginia - esque parts of Pennsylvania

As I said in the OP, even had Sandwrs won all four states you mention and everything Clinton did, [Trump still has 259 electoral votes.](http://www.270towin.com/maps/0Gl1P) If Trump wins any one other state in the Midwest he wins, and that's not even factoring in Booomberg. 

> Furthermore, there is no reason why Bernie would be weaker with black voters in states like Ohio, North Carolina, and Florida than Tim Kaine, who has absolutely no power to change a vote in any state by force of personality except Virginia. 

I don't think Sanders, who did badly with black people, can really win NC and FL if Clinton couldn't. Black people weren't going to vote in Obama-level numbers anyways. I don't see much potential difference WRT black votes between Bernie and HRC. 

> The most successful attack line Trump used on Hillary was her credibility/emails.

That's because Trump knew that would effectively hurt Hillary. With Sanders he'll just use the "he's a Commie" line of attack instead. 

> Statistically, Democrats win elections with higher turnout, in midterms and general elections.

Interesting, could you source that?
