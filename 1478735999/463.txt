That's sort of the goal of the protest, though - force yourself to be heard when others do not want to hear it. It's part of why the Civil Rights Movement was so successful - they were persistent, peaceful, and vocal, and eventually people couldn't ignore them any longer. I'm fully with you when protests turn violent, but peacefully protesting en masse is trying to do exactly that - force others to hear voices they do not want to give time to.
