> I find this stereotyping disturbing and disingenuous. It's like me saying your Nike shoes were sourced from a 3rd world country which may have children working in the factories. Therefore, because you support Nike, you are a terrible supporter of slavery and child labor, and you have no humanity in you.

What's wrong in making that last statement? Why is this unhealthy? In particular, it inspires people to instead shop for shoes from name brands that specifically market themselves as being made in the USA or made without the use of child labor. This is the definition of a search for truth: you learn that Nike is supported by child labor and so you search for companies that do not rely on child labor.

I'm so confused why this is your argument.
