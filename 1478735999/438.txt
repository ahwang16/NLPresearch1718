But the thing is, there is objective evidence that proves the gender of the politicians is inconsequential. It is objectively true that women have more legal rights than men do, despite there being a dominance of male politicians.

I may *feel* bad if most of the politicians were female, but reality tells me that this doesn't actually matter. Facts tell me that both men and women politicians are equally capable of making my life better or worse.

I happen to be male, but I don't "identify as a male". I'm a person, and I'm an American.

So yes, I honestly believe that I wouldn't consider it important.
