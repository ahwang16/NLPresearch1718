>We figure, yeah, they may be upset about the economy, but how is that a justification for sanctioning that kind of talk? Sure, they may feel disenfranchised, but how is that reason to ignore the unacceptability of the rhetoric.

And that's where the left lost them:

"Sure, you can't pay your rent but social equality is *far* more important than your car being repossessed."

"Maybe you haven't had a job in 18 months, but we need to focus on free secondary education."

"Any discussion about immigration that doesn't include amnesty is racist."

"You don't have any *real* problems because you're privelaged."

>We expected the American public to stand with us against racism and misogyny, and were sorely disappointed.

They don't feel that they are racist or misogynistic ,nor do they feel they are contributing to racism or misogyny.  Being told over and over and over again that avoiding the stigmatic label of the left is more important than anything else is wearying.  

The message heard: "If you aren't a liberal Democrat, you're a racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobe."

And the response became: "If that's what they think, then fuck them!"

This person expressed the sentiment pretty well:
