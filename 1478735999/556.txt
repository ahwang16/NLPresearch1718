Didn't you just say that seeing people lose jobs and friends was too much?  
Don't you see how you spring trump, someone who exploits those loopholes a lot, and who is notorious for firing people, costing them jobs and homes and for bankruptcy is strange?
Hilary may not have fixed them, but he actively took advantage of them on numerous occasions, is proud of it, and when people like yourself get upset... He just laughs and does it again.  
Better the devil you know. To link to the debate at hand: he's actively bad, Hilary is just apathetic... Which is worse?  
   
Also, at the risk of getting my comment removed:. 
I'm sure you know people think trump supporters like yourself are stupid and dislike the assertion. However, do you see how to someone on the outside looking at you, at least on paper, supporting someone who does not have your interest at Heart and even seems to actively be a source of several of the things you've complained about.... Could make that assumption about you?  
Again, not saying you are, but this is relevant to your complaint about being misjudged
