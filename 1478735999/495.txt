I do agree, I make quite a few assumptions in this view.

Where you say I "use my own definitions", please be explicit and maybe you can help expand my vocabulary.

I don't want to spend too much time defending the analogy as it's peripheral to my viewpoint and only useful as a tool of expression.

But let's say you and I are on a sinking lifeboat, and you point your gun at me and tell me to start bailing water.

If I refuse, you'll shoot me, and then start bailing the water yourself.

The decision to shoot me represents refusing to allow public funding, and my death represents those millions who could die if the environment got worse instead of better, and bailing the water yourself represents how those with accumulated wealth would be better equipped to survive such an event, even though their new lifestyle wouldn't be quite as luxurious as they wished.
