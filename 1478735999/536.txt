>I asked my lawyer if I should ask for payment upfront, and he laughed. “It’s Donald Trump!” he told me. “He’s got lots of money.”

Does that sound like something a lawyer would / should say? Any lawyer who said that to me would instantly be fired. If he had a contract, I guarantee it wasn't with Trump. It might not even be with the casino. It was likely with an interior design agency, given the size of the project.

Did he talk to a lawyer when was presented with a 70% haircut? Doesn't seem like it. Surely, he hasn't used up the retainer with the lawyer that told him not to take payment up front. Why wasn't it an option to take the piano back? Why wasn't returning the piano to the suppliers an option? Did he even have a lawyer? In fact, did he even have a contract? Did he get greedy and try to push extra product to the casino that they didnt want?

Stories like these are very easy to disregard if you have a bigger understanding of how these situations work. I don't believe you're qualified to assess these situations fairly. This is a very one sided story and you don't possess the insight to see what may really be going on when the other side is not available to present an argument.
