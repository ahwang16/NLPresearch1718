Are you sure that's what happened? Or is that what you got from the media? Have you ever done business with a small business owner? Have you ever tried to renovate your home and have the contractor keep asking for money after you've agreed to a fixed cost? Have you ever had to deal with them lowering the quality of the agreed service? Maybe delaying you project in order to squeeze in another project even though a timeline was already agreed upon? Do you know the specifics of the case that you're referring to?
