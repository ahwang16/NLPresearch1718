The reality is that we can never know. Keep in mind, Trump had a 30% chance of winning and well we know how that ended.

Now it is likely that Bernie would have lost because as a society we aren't ready for socialism. However a lot of the reason Trump won was that he appealed to the working class whites. 

Bernie's message was similar to Trump's in that it was a populist message. So who knows.
