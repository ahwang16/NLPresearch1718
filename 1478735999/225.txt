They tried this. Over and over agian. Hillary kept talking on and on in her rallies in the swing states how her economic policies would help them. People just ignored them because Trump's plan was fantastic - say crazy, bigoted, sexist, xenophobic shit to stir up the media so nobody sees or gives a shit about actual policy.

The proof of this nonsense is Trump has suggested absolutely not a single fucking thing that would ACTUALLY bring jobs back short of forcing employers to pay .50c an hour for their work.
