> I'm accused of horrible things for little more than I probably just believe tax rates should be a couple of percentage points lower than you do.

Not quite. You're being called horrible things because you cared more about that couple of percentage points of taxes than you cared about the safety and lives of minorities whose parents may now get deported, lgbt individuals who likely may have rights rolled back, women who may no longer be able to gain access to abortions etc. You cared more about the tiny differences you are speaking about than a candidate whose rhetoric emboldened actual Nazis and was endorsed by the KKK.
