That's the issue op is talking about. On both sides really.  It should be the other way around.  Regardless of info being fact or fiction, if *you* can't communicate with the other side without hurting their feelings, then that's on *you*. You can't control how people feel about things, but attempting to understand how they feel and helping with that is something that America in general lacks right now. That's why we are so polarized and divided. We've lost empathy for one another, and with that we've lost the ability to compromise.
