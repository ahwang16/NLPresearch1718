As citizens of a democratic republic, Americans have the right to vote in (among other things) federal elections. However, there seems to be an increasing trend of criticizing and shaming people who don't vote, particularly on social media. With respect to yesterday's election, see [here](https://twitter.com/chiaramiddleton/status/796443317080768512), [here](https://twitter.com/CGBPosts/status/796206374208282624) and [here](https://twitter.com/harto/status/796370401177825280) for examples. 

Change my view, Reddit, because I believe that **there is nothing wrong with not voting. Nobody should be criticized for failing/refusing to vote.**

The main reasons that people criticize/shame others are:

1. **They believe that the right to vote equates with an obligation to vote.** 

This is simply not true; just because a citizen holds a right does not mean that they are obligated to exercise that right. Citizens also have the right to bear arms but nobody is forced to be a gun owner. 

2. **They believe that, by not voting, a person's voice is not being heard.** 

Again, this equates a right with a duty. Part of free choice is having the choice to not give an opinion. Each non-voter has their own reason for failing or refusing to vote, and there is no wrong reason for choosing not to cast a ballot. Some people are uninformed, others are apathetic because the results won't affect them in any major way. And this does not mean that that person should be obligated to attend and spoil their ballot -- there is no reason for doing that. 

3. **They are unhappy with the result and attempt to shift the blame for their "loss" to non-voters.**

This one is actually quite prevalent right now. I can't count the number of profanities aimed at non-voters for "ruining America." However, the fact of the matter is that Hillary Clinton had 47.66% of the popular vote, while Donald Trump had 47.50%, for a difference of 0.16 percentage points. Based on those numbers, it is impossible to say whether non-voters would have voted one way or the other, and it is therefore completely baseless to blame non-voters for the results. It is just as likely that an increase in voter turnout could have caused Donald Trump to win by a wider margin.
