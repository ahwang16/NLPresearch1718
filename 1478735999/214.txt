>Anyway... what do you suggest liberals do? We care about living in a country where marginalized people feel safe and welcome... we think it's wrong when someone infringes on that, and Trump's language certainly did, in many ways.

I would suggest engaging in open dialogue and explaining why Clinton's economic policies might be better for people than Trumps.

I would also not use the word "racist" since I do not believe that Trump has ever made a racist statement during his campaign. The words bigoted or xenophobic are fine, but racist carries an especially derogatory connotation and it is untrue when used to describe candidate Trump.


I would also suggest that if liberals accuse Trump or his supporters of being bigoted, they should do it in a civilized manner. No condescension, no "Fuck Trump" signs, and no calling people deplorable.

>The thing that confuses me is that you say it caused you pain. I certainly don't defend anyone calling anyone a redneck, but if someone thinks you're a racist for supporting Trump despite (or because of) what he says, does that really hurt you?

Alright it might have been a over-dramatic choice of words. A more appropriate word might be anger or annoyance.
