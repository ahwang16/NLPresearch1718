Well the easiest evidence to strongly suggests your view is wrong is that both Trump and Hillary are viewed highly unfavorable. Nearly 2/3 of the country views trump and he still won which strongly suggests that a lot of a his support was people voting against Hillary rather than for him. To assume he would still have that support against Obama, who is very popular, is faulty logic.
