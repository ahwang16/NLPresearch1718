Premise 1: Trump is sexist, racist and bigoted in general.

Premise 2: Actively supporting sexism, racism etc. makes you a sexist/racist yourself.

Premise 3: helping a sexist/racist become president is actively supporting sexism/racism

/----------------------------------------------------------------------/
Conclusion: Every Trump-Voter is a sexist/racist

From what I've read so far many uneducated white males from rural areas voted for Trump. From my logic I would see them all as racists and sexists.
On the one hand I will not stop shaming racists for being racists but on the other hand I'm deeply convinced that the strong identity politics of the Democrats that shamed these group is exactly the wrong approach to closing the political divide in the country. 

For example I agree with these two positions:

and

 https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5c4e36/cmv_to_win_in_2018_and_2020_democrats_need_to/

I don't want to compromise with racists/sexists but at the same time I want the political left to compromise with racists/sexists.
Please help me find the error in my logic!
