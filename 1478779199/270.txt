CMV: WIKILEAKS AND FOREIGN HACKERS CHANGED THE OUTCOME OF THE AMERICAN ELECTION

I think that it's easy to forget the timing of everything.  The DNC emails were probably hacked in May but leaked on the eve of the Convention - a convention that Wasserman Schultz had been planning for a year.  Yes, the Clinton campaign could have done better in their reaction, but they were put into a very tough situation with the timing - which was decided by the hackers, not the campaign.  Maybe even one extra day would have been enough to get Wasserman Schultz and the DNC to accept a harsher demotion, but they didn't have that time - they did what they thought they needed to do to run a good Convention.

And firing Podesta doesn't even make any sense - for what, clicking on a phishing link?  His e-mail was apparently hacked in March but not released by Wikileaks until October.  The vast majority of the issues in the e-mails have nothing to do with Podesta's behavior - it is comments and actions by staff members or people outside of the campaign, like Donna Brazile or Sidney Blumenthal or Michael Froman.  I don't recall any of Bernie Sanders's supporters calling for Podesta's head.

And of course, as you say, if the emails hadn't leaked, there would be no reason for any reaction, and the campaign could have been much more successful at staying on message and likely winning the election.  That only reinforces my view that the leaks changed the outcome.
