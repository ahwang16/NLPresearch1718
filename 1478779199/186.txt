>Compare this to going after the source of the labor. We know where they are getting in - it's a few thousand miles of border between the US and Mexico.

I suspect most of them are from Earth, too... that's really not restricting the target usefully.

Most illegal immigrants are actually overstaying legitimate visas at this point... assuming there even is a net inflow of illegal immigrants at all any more... the trend has been reversing for at least a decade.

Furthermore, you don't have to catch *all* of the businesses, just enough of them to keep the others in line... like most other laws. Going after people that have something to lose is almost *always* a more effective law enforcement strategy than trying to stem the tide of people with little to lose.
