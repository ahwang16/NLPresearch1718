if you want a different kind of fight, you could check out r/whowouldwin. Its very well moderated and incredible well mannered considering it often comes down to fanboys arguing.

Or you could go outside. Turn off the TV and put down the phone. Often it's the best way to clear my head and remind me that the world is still sane and the sun will still rise.
