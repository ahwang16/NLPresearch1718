And why won't humans be able to overcome the warming climate and changing weather patterns?

We've got some damn good technology and I'm fairly confident we will figure out ways of dealing with it.  Sure, we'll lose some parts of Florida and some third world populations are going to suffer massively, but I really don't think that global warming is going to cause the death of every (or nearly every) human on the planet.

During the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the only option they had was evolution.  Obviously that's a slow painful process so species died out.  Humans have infinitely better methods of adapting and won't be stuck trying to evolve out of a changing climate.

Having typed all this, now I'm unsure of whether you are referring to the elimination of humans or all the other species that aren't humans.  The discussion of the Fermi Paradox had me thinking you thought all humans would die out, but now I'm realizing it might be that loads of animal populations will go extinct.  If it's the second option, then obviously my argument isn't relevant.
