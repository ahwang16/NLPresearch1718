I'm a white male from a rural-ish area. I'm "uneducated." I went into the trades instead of college. I voted for Trump. Not because I'm racist or sexist. Because I genuinely believe that Clinton is ridiculously corrupt, only in it for the money, and would have definitely increased tensions with Russia and others, possibly going as far as full scale war. I believe Trump will not advance or start conflicts. I believe he can improve the economy. There's a list of things I believe he will do better that I don't feel like typing out. 

I also believe the two party system is terrible. We need more parties. 4 would be a good starter. 

I know I'm just some random stranger on the internet and you don't have to believe anything I say. But I would have gladly voted for a woman, of any race, with conservative economic values had that been an option. But not Clinton. Basically anyone but Clinton.
