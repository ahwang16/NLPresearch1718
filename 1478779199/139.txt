Everyone is a little racist. Humans are pattern recognizing animals; it's a very useful survival technique.

>Saying racist things makes your racist (kinda convinced by this)

And I would generally agree, but you get into a problem where you are using a word to define a word. Its basically a tautology. 

So first you have to define what racism is. I personally, do not think making a joke about someone's race to be racism. People make jokes all the time about men, women, blacks, whites, Hispanics, etc. They also makes jokes about airlines and phone companies, sports teams and cities. They're jokes, they rely on commonality to be funny, nothing more.

If you say or do something with the intent to cause harm, resentment, or division of a certain group (or promote a certain group in the same way), you are being racist (or sexist, etc.). Again, just my opinion. Al Sharpton race baiting is racist. Dave Chappelle in white face isn't.

Going back to Trump, I don't believe he has said or done anything *to cause harm, resentment, or division of a certain group*. This ultimately comes down to a judgment call, though, and people see what they are looking for. Do racist people listen to Trump and hear what they want to hear? Probably. Do media outlets listen to Trump and hear what will sell the most? Probably. Do people who are looking to be offended find things to be offended by? Apparently they do. 

It's important to not get caught up in the moment (God knows I'm guilty of this some times) and take time to watch from afar. Let all your predispositions behind, just for a few minutes, and if after that, you listen to Trump or Sharpton or Chappelle and, genuinely, you still find racism, then you are probably right.
