> I'm in charge of managing my time and government should not be telling me what to do with it.

First of all, just jettison this nonsense right now. The government impinges on your "time" already, in a multitude of ways. Just one example is the requirement to submit your tax returns. 

> Think of those who are unable to vote. Think of those who are too busy to vote.

Those problems are very easily solved. Make a federal law that requires all states to allow early and mail-in ballots. It's insane that this isn't already a thing. It is not an undue burden to tell people they have a month to mail in a ballot that will take all of 60 seconds to complete (no postage necessary, with the ballot mailed to your address as soon as it's set)

>Also, how would you control that (think about the cost!)?

The cost doesn't change that dramatically. Most people would vote remotely if they were given the option to do so that required no additional effort on their part. 

> "not voting" is in fact one of the choices given to the voters.

Ballots could easily include a 'no choice' option. At least that would let us track turn out without guessing games. 

> You'll never get 100% of population anyway 

You don't need 100% of the population. But 55% of the eligible voter population is an embarrassment. 

>will they go to prison, will you fine them?

Yeah. $50 fine. You can either participate in the process or you can help fund it for the people that do. 

I don't necessarily agree that compulsory voting is a good idea - but your objections are without merit.
