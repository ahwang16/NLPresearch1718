>The Prime Directive calls for annihilation of a species as opposed to intervention, so I don't really think that this is a good justification. (TNG S2E15)

That's about a bunch of aliens dying, not a bunch of federation citizens dying, and so a much smaller concern.

>If the only way to avoid the Borg overwhelming the Federation was to intervene on some sub-warp planet and direct production of X thing, they wouldn't do it.

They would. They have blackops people for especially dirty jobs, so they'd just send them in and look the other way. They have no qualms about violating their morality for very important causes. 


>Aside from the Omega Directive, the Prime Directive doesn't have many get out of jail free cards. It's not about weighing the benefit versus the negatives, it's about a moral decision that intervention is wrong.

There are numerous get out of jail free cards- acting on official orders, protecting a federation citizen, responding to a hail, diplomatic contact, correcting past interference, and captains could send justification back to star fleet about why a particular situation was justified. It was hardly an absolute law.

Famously, it was ok for him to violate the rules of this society to protect a federation citizen. The prime directive is a thing to die for, but it's a thing a single federation citizen can override. A colony is certainly worth it. They don't value random alien lives that highly compared to federation ones.
