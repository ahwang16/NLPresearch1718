The businesses are hard to keep track of? Aren't they paying taxes and likely granted various permits or licenses depending on what industry they are in?  
  
And on "much harder to police the cheese than the hole the mice are getting in", I disagree, you certainly try to close up the holes, but if you're leaving table scraps everywhere, they're going to find their way in.  
  
Also, how many immigrants are there vs how many businesses hiring them? Surely the businesses are fewer in number and relatively easier to find. And as to more popping up where one has closed, are there not more immigrants to fill the space left by the most recently deported?
