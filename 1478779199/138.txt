Oh that is a very similar topic that I struggle with a lot. I could make a new CMV post about that along the lines:

- Saying racist things makes your racist (kinda convinced by this)

- almost everybody says racist things at some point

--> almost everybody is racist

I don't want everybody to be racist so please change my view
