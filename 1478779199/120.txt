Say, for the sake of argument, that I'm a deeply religious, Catholic Latino, whose grandparents immigrated legally from Mexico.

I recognize that Donald Trump is a dangerous lunatic who makes it more likely that I and my children will become the target of racist violence in the next four years.

My religion states that abortion and gay marriage are unacceptable, and I believe that it is a moral imperative to support any candidate who will appoint Supreme Court justices who feel the same way.

By your logic, if I support Clinton, I am pro-gay marriage. If I support Trump, I am a self-hating racist.

There's more to it, is all I'm saying.
