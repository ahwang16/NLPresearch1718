>Trump has certainly said racist, sexist things, but his actions don't really suggest he is worse than the average person.

I and others don't accept that first premise. The "locker room talk" he was recorded on is downright disgusting. I've been in plenty of locker rooms and *no* man I know speaks about women that way. Thinking about a man talking about my mother, my girlfriend, my sister, or any woman I know that way makes my blood boil. If it doesn't make your blood boil too, then yeah, I'd say you've got a bit of misogyny going on.
