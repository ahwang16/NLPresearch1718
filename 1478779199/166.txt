I'd be careful about characterizing people like that.  Disagreeing with people is perfectly fine, but when you start calling them derogatory names just because they have a different world view, you start causing the very problems we have right now.

Many analysts are attributing part of Trumps victory to the way that the liberal establishment villainized and talked down to middle America this election; they didn't take into account that there are people who can logically hold opposing viewpoints without being "selfish" or "ignorant".  

We need to stop thinking of our opponents as dumb and start talking to them like real people with legitimate concerns.
