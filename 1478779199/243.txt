Let's say in a perfect world you achieve your objectives and illegal immigrants could be completely wiped from America's lands to her neighbors' borders - let's say that could happen. 

Americans now have a lot of low-paying jobs. Fine jobs for some, but not enough for a nation to build on. This can not replace outsourced manufacturing. It does not come close. Blaming brown people does not fix the problem.
