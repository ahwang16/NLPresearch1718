I voted for Clinton, but not because I support her views. That does not make me anything. Likewise voting for Trump does not make one any of the things that Trump represents. The only thing it means is that they liked Trump more than Clinton.

The vast majority of Trump voters were probably just Republicans voting for the Republican nominee because he was the Republican nominee.
