Many of them didn't vote for Trump because he is a racist. I would also say that profiling every single person based on who they voted for is pretty discriminatory as well. The way I see it, a vote for Hillary was a vote for war with Russia, no question about it. Voting for a person like Trump is the lesser of two evils, because there aren't bombs getting dropped on our heads right now.  
  
I personally didn't vote for either of them, but hating every single person that did vote Trump makes you no better than the people you are bashing without even meeting.
