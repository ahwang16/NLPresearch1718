I agree that the DNC deserves blame for favoring Hillary over Bernie, but that doesn't mean the hackers are not at fault.  The hackers chose to release the DNC emails days before the Convention when they clearly had the emails since at least in May or even earlier.  These leaks could have been revealed while the primary was still contested, when voters could have chosen Bernie over Hillary, over even just a few weeks earlier, giving Bernie more time to asks for concessions and changes to the DNC, maybe even opening the door to Bernie as VP.

Instead, the DNC e-mail leaks happened at a time where the maximum damage could be done to Hillary, and the maximum benefit could be given to Trump.  That was a pattern with all of these leaks.
