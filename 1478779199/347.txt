Its not a case of the DNC planning out an easy path for Hillary Clinton to win the primary over Bernie Sanders. Its the DNC creating a primary system that gives preference to the establishment candidate. It does so with tactics like early voter registration cutoff, super-delegates, and the electoral college-esque system. Hillary Clinton just happens to be this cycles establishment candidate.
