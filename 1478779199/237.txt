CMV: IF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE TAKING AMERICAN JOBS, AND THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM, WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER THE ENTITIES EMPLOYING THE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.

I'm late to this discussion, but here's two cents worth.

I have worked in the restaurant business off and on for many years. It's been the same everywhere, but the last place will suffice as an example. I was hired as a co-general manager. Every kitchen worker, and I mean EVERY kitchen worker was illegal. It took a few months to figure it all out, but it wasn't hard. First, most could only understand work related English (small red flag). Second, when I was asked to handle new hires I noticed that some of the required ID's were obviously faked. I refused to sign off on the documents, which led to a conversation with my co-manager. Basically, they will work their ass of for $8 an hour, and accept crazy work schedules without complaint for fear of being outted. As long as the corporate office can show the required documentation, their ass is covered. It's not their job to check if it is valid.

So, if  these illegal immigrants were deported tomorrow, there would be few restaurants able to open their doors without training new help. And the new help wouldn't do that job for $8 an hr. So, there goes their profits, or up goes the prices.

There's an underground market for fake documents. And the business world knows this. Their asses are covered.

As a side note, each of those "illegals" were good people. I can't fault them for doing what they can to make a better life.
