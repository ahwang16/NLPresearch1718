It pretty much relies on there being a set of policies all bundled together. Some are racist and help only whites and/or hurt non-whites. Some are more broadly applicable, and vastly improve the economy. While I don't think that is what will actually happen with republican policies, it's a pretty reasonable description of what many people believe will happen, which is what actually matters when deciding if they are racist.
