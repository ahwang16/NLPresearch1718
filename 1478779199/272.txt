I am not just asking why these emails were leaked but also why they were leaked at the time they were leaked.

John Podesta's email was hacked in March 2016, in the middle of the Democratic primaries, but the emails were not released at that time, when Democratic voters could have decided to nominate Bernie Sanders instead.  Similarly, the DNC was hacked in May but these e-mails were not released until after Bernie had already endorsed Hillary and the Democrats were on the eve of their Convention.

If we the public deserved to know these things, then we should have known them as soon as possible - instead we only learned this information when it was too late to help Bernie, when it did the most damage to Hillary, and when it had the most benefit for Trump.

There is no evidence that NBC found the Access Hollywood tape during the primaries but hid it until October to benefit Hillary - it was leaked at the end of the week that it was found.  The tape certainly influenced the election, but the timing and nature of its release did not appear to fit any particular agenda.

In contrast, the e-mail leaks have been scheduled with a very specific agenda, with months-long gaps between the hacks and the release of information.  They seemed to be timed to disrupt the Clinton campaign without benefiting the Sanders campaign, and to help to elect Trump.  Yes, the content of the emails troubles me, but the people who wrote those emails just lost an election and they will not be in power.  But whoever hacked and released the emails has seemed to achieve their goal, and they have put their favored candidate into power - that troubles me a lot more right now.
