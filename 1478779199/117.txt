I have two separate arguments to make here. 

1) There are only two choices (yeah, yeah, third party and all that is great but meaningless), so sometimes you have to make a difficult choice and vote for someone who says things you don't agree with. Voters can take a look at Trump's policies as a whole and decide they like them better than Hillary's. It doesn't mean they agree with everything Trump says. 

2) Trump's a confirmed bad person. He's bad out loud. That doesn't mean other politicians aren't bad people too, they just hide it better. I know for a fact that even though they think Trump's a legitimately lousy guy, they still trust him more than Hillary. Some voters may rationalize their choice by saying "At least I can take some of what Trump says at face value, since the guy is clearly not a good enough liar to keep himself out of hot water with what he says. There's an attitude of "the devil you know is better than the devil you don't". 

In the end, I think Trump voters by and large fall into one or both of these camps. Sure, there are probably people who voted for him because he says Mexicans are rapists, or who honestly like his attitude toward women, but that's a small part. 38 percent of all women who voted chose Trump, do you really think they all like his treatment of women? They voted for him in spite of that, not because of it.
