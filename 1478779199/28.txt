This is a terrible idea, I'm in charge of managing my time and government should not be telling me what to do with it.

Think of all those people who work every single day, especially those in emergency services, but also those who have to be on duty or on call. Think of those who are unable to vote. Think of those who are too busy to vote. Think of those who don't want to vote. Can you see what I'm trying to say?

Also, how would you control that (think about the cost!)? You'll never get 100% of population anyway and those who didn't vote, will they go to prison, will you fine them? 1% doesn't seem like a lot, but that's roughly 3,180,000 people.

It's a democratic vote, and "not voting" is in fact one of the choices given to the voters.
