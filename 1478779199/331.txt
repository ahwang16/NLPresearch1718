No sure, I think there are valid criticisms of the DNC and how it conducts itself. My issue is with the idea of rigging put forward by Bernie supporters and enthusiastically continued by Trump. So far I see that he "rigging" of the primary was the exact same as he "rigging" of the general. That is to say there were rules in place already that can be criticized and maybe should be changed (for the general there is the fact that she won the popular vote but lost the electoral) but do not show a conspiracy of people opposing the losers.
