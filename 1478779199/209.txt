A "bust" just happened here in Buffalo, N.Y. Roughly 2 weeks ago. 4 Mexican restaurants were raided. The owner and 2 managers were arrested, assets seized (there will be a Porsche up for auction soon), and the undocumented workers were taken into custody.

They were working these guys 14 hour days, making then all live in one tight apartment and paying roughly $500 a pay period.

They released most of the workers unless they had records. Those guys were deported.
