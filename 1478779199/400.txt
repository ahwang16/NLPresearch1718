At least some of those people who voted Trump would not have if the alternative was Barack Obama. Trump had the highest unfavorability rating of a major presidential candidate going into an election ever. Roughly 60 percent of voters said he did not have the temperament to be president. Twenty percent of those people voted for him anyway because they perceived Hillary Clinton as worse. In any other election against virtually any other opponent, these would have been decisive factors.
