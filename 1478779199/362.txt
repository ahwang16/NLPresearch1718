>"The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules; it is a philosophy... and a very correct one. History has proven again and again that whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilization, no matter how well intentioned that interference may be, the results are invariably disastrous."

Jean Luc Picard.

They're against interfering with primitive species because it has bad results. If colonizing type M planets hasn't had bad results they wouldn't do that either.

Action is always a compromise between their desire for internal and external security, economic needs, desire for new scientific data, lots of things. While yes, hypothetically bad stuff could happen that's not enough to outweigh the many benefits of colonists.

If the borg invaded space and assimilated everyone because the Federation wasn't rich enough to support an army to stop them would you still be arguing it was a bad idea to make colonies? There are many threats.
