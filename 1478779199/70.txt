> you can't really compare TPP to a cultural issue like discrimination

Are you saying that cultural issues over ride all other issues despite practicality?  Lets say we have one candidate(S) that wants to enslave black people.  This policy has zero support.  His opponent(T) wants to tax the poorest third of households at 80% and eliminate public school and transit, this policy has lots of support in congress.  Your saying just by voting for S your racist, even though S's plan won't pass and T's plan will disproportionately hurt black people.

Also voting against one person is not voting for the other.  Lets say we have candidate S from before and they are going up against candidate W.  W thinks women shouldn't be allowed to vote or work outside the home, he has little support on this.  W also wants to legalize rape of women and outlaw abortion both of which there is support for.  Given this situation you have to decide to vote for slavery or no rights for women.  Again if you vote for S because his only problem is the whole slavery thing no one supports that means you support slavery.
