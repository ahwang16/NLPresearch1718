A certain segment of any civilization and mankind is corrupt and malevolent. Men want to rule and dominate the primitive natives and steal their resources. Natives want powerful weapons and technology to dominate the weak. In a large scale interaction it's inevitable that bad things will happen. A smaller scale interaction is much more controllable, and can be less disastrous if the people are more ethical.
