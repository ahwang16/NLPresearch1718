An argument could be made that Clinton is more racist than Trump. 

Clinton _collected_ people of other races for _her own gain_. She used PoC as _props_ for her speeches. The composition of the audience behind her was deliberate and curated. She methodically tallied the race flavors employed in her campaign. (See Wikileaks.) 

Trump, on the other hand, is personal friends with a number of black people and has been for decades. He doesn't collect people, he's friends with them because he likes them.
