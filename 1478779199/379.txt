>the colonists would simply become part of the planets life cycle

Which would then have a massive impact on its development/evolution.  A sentient species may never evolve because of the colonist's impact.


>and even if we did have an effect on the sentient population after that it would essentially be the same as the french meeting the dutch, two separate nationalities who's technological development isn't exactly the same. 

Maybe.  Until their technology advances sufficiently in order to determine that you are definitely not the same species and definitely did not originate on this planet.  Assuming this happens before they develop warp speed (which it might), they would then have the knowledge that alien species do exist.  Knowledge that the Prime Directive forbids one from revealing.

Now, the real issue is that colonists are civilians, generally.  And civillians have no duty to uphold the Prime Directive, so as soon as a sentient species evolves, the civillians (that were put there by Starfleet) could and probably would interfere.  

Now, this is not a direct violation of the Prime Directive, and Starfleet doesn't have to actively prevent civillians from violating the Prime Directive (See TNG episode "Angel One"), but we never see Captain Janeway having Seven of Nine (who isn't part of Starfleet) violate the Prime Directive on her behalf, so I believe that Starfleet cannot put civilians in situations where they would violate the Prime Directive, but if those civilians get into the situation themselves then there is no necessity to avoid it.
