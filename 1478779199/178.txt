To use your example, it's much harder to police the cheese than the hole the mice are using to get in.

The problem with going after the employers is that for every one that you catch and put out of business, another one will take his place.  It is too easy for a business to open up _anywhere_ in the US and easily find undocumented, cheap labor.  Trying to police the businesses themselves would take a huge amount of time and money since there are just so many to keep track of and it is so easy to hide undocumented laborers if you get wind of a raid.

Compare this to going after the source of the labor.  We _know_ where they are getting in - it's a few  thousand miles of border between the US and Mexico.  That is _much_ easier to allocate resources to such a small area where _everyone_ that is coming across can either be screened in one place or is crossing illegally.  

Now, all of that said we are doing _both_ - we do raid businesses all the time when we get wind that they are using undocumented labor.  Its just that there isn't much more we can do there.
