Alright then.  So let's say they want to prioritize economics over environment.


Even if they don't believe in climate change, it must be apparent that fossil fuels won't last us forever.  Rising gas prices can attest to that.  So isn't it a good idea economically to promote the development of alternative, more sustainable energy sources?  The same argument applies to recycling over landfills and other sustainable policies.


Also, even if they don't believe in global climate change, obviously pumping poisonous gasses and liquids into the environment can't be healthy.  We have some definitive examples where this is a problem (Flint, Michigan for example).  Shouldn't we strive for clean business practices for that reason?


And lastly, they should "believe" in climate change because there is overwhelming scientific evidence that it is real.  And assuming you accept that, isn't it in the economic interest of the country to ensure the habitability of the planet?  Why do we even need an economic interest for that to be important?




**But wait,** Trump's platform isn't that we are focusing on the environment too much and that's hurting us economically, it's that the environment *doesn't matter at all*.  In order to support that, you must be a climate change denier.  (Trump vocally is one.  If there is some other way to support such a policy, enlighten me).



You said you had a legitimate argument to prioritize economics over environment.  Let me hear it.
