How do you objectively define terrible?  

Everything you listed in your response are things that you _personally_ may disagree with, but there are many people in this country that would be _very_ happy if each of those things came to pass and would tout the presidency as an unqualified success.  

If you disagree with those policies then it is fair to say that he will be a POTUS that you will be unhappy with and that is just fine.  That doesn't mean he will be terrible, though; it just means that you will disagree with him.
