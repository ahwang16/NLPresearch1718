Ah but see there's a difference between the two in that in one case Trump was going against Hilary where the other case the DNC should not promoting one over the other. The point is for the voters who make up the party to decide not the people in charge of the organization. If you are looking for illegal activity then no there hasn't been any illegal activity that's been exposed. The question is rather should the DNA be promoting one of the candidates over the other and is it ethically right to do so. If you believe that as long as it wasn't illegal then it's not wrong then that's your opinion. Many believe that since it is an internal election the people in charge should show no favoritism or work for one over the other because that hurts the integrity of the election.
