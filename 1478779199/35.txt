The United States is founded on the principle or liberty, or having the choice to do whatever you want as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others. 

So forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do is contradictory to US principles. Some people would go as far as to say it's slavery. 

All my friends who are eligible but do not vote often say they do not vote because they don't like the candidates. 

Since there are more than 2 different types of political views, most Americans are not properly represented. I wish the media would focus on more than two types of political ideas in order to get more people out to vote.
