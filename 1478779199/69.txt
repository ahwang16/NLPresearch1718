> I know what you are trying to say but you can't really compare TPP to a cultural issue like discrimination:


That is your own opinion, but maybe not the opinion of somebody who lost their job, and who's entire community was decimated because of TPP. Besides, you know that Hillary used to be opposed to gay marriage, right? Assuming she still was, would voting for her instead of Trump make you a homophobe? (AFAIK, Trump isn't anti-gay.)
