Also so you are aware it's widely believed that the US is building near its max with its current construction. On mobile so I'll get you sources when I get to a pic. Long story short I'm a material and architectural solutions provider in this industry. I have about 5 large scale jobs ranging from the new apple and coke headquarters to small commercial developments, they are all months to years behind schedule largely due to the shortage of labor. Things such as plumbers, dry wall installers and many other subs in div 5-10 are booked with so much work that GCs are having to turn down work because they can't fill positions with subs.
