You think he wasn't asked about his religion? I guess you missed this [town hall meeting.] (https://youtu.be/YWnvBFwojNM) 

The DNC bylaws specifically say they must not act preferentially. They broke their own charter in trying to sway the nomination which is highly documented. More voters registered because of Bernie's infectious potential and yet voter turnout fell in Nov. When the DNC acted as a stalwart for Clinton they usurped their constituents. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was fired from the DNC and then hired by the Clinton campaign... Expecting the millions of Sanders voters to ignore their flagrant marginalisation is exactly the definition of white privilege.
