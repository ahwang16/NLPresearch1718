That position realistically taken to its full extent means no one can vote for anyone. Anyone who votes for Trump supports every Trump policy would logically extend to everyone who supported Obama (in his re-election in 2012) supports every policy Obama instituted before 2012, so everyone who voted for Obama in 2012 supports the use of drones to assassinate civilians in countries outside active war zones.
