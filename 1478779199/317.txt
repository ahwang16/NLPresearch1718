I don't follow, cities don't vote homogeneously so just looking at how a city votes won't give the result, though obviously a city like New York will have a much bigger impact than the town of Buford, WY, a 'town' with a population of 1.   
  
Even if the city dwelling population all voted x and the rural dewlling popualtion all voted y it is obvious that x should win. Why should the rural vote count for more than the city vote?
