Your logic on this is flawed. The EC vote is still dependent on the popular vote in that state so states that voted for Obama in 2008/2012 and switched to trump in 2016 like OH and FL would be higher in contention than vs Hilary but Hilary is vastly different than Obama in those states where Ohio for the past 12 years have mostly swung to Democrats but switched to Trump for this election but as someone from Ohio (funny enough I live in FL now) Obama was extremely popular in Ohio. Your using raw votes and EC votes but don't take into the context of each election. Plus Obama had 6m votes to Trump's 5.6 that would completely change the EC votes and distribution. Your comparing oranges (hehe) to apples.
