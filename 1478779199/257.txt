I'm calling bullshit on the "already have" part of that statement. We have no idea whether a multigenerational colony of humans could even be viable at 0.38g. Catastrophic medical conditions are a real possibility. We can't say we have the technology to sustainably colonize Mars when we don't even really know what all the challenges are or whether it is possible.
