Regardless even with raw numbers the difference between Obama and Hillary across the country would easily give Hillary the election. Even if we use your raw numbers (which are flawed because they assume trump didn't pick up Obama votes that he still would have picked up against Obama which is absurd), Obama would still easily win the electoral college even if a state here or there were different.
