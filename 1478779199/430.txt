One problem I see is this: Even if UBI is implemented, people will still not be happy. Sure they won't have to worry about hunger or loosing their home, but it will probably not be very high basic income. So they will still be a lower class.

People do not wish to live on handouts from the state. They want to be independent, self sufficient, feel like they do valuable work. They just want to do this as farmers, craftsmen, etc., rather than as intellectuals. People want **dignity**, UBI does not supply them with this.
