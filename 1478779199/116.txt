A lot of people, probably even most people that vote don't know every detail of either candidate. 

Both candidates did a lot of mud slinging toward each other which included stretching the truth and taking things out of context in order to make their opponent look worse.

Most democrats get their news from liberal leaning sources just like republicans get their news from right leaning sources.

In this situation, you will have Trump supporters that have seen memes on Facebook, jokes on "Last Week Tonight", and mindless insults/rants from people like Amy Schumer. The look into some of those issues and find that the entire truth wasn't represented or that it was an outright lie. Once they see things like this they will start to assume that an negative news about Trump that comes from any left leaning sources will be dishonest.

Consider all of these factors and then put yourself in the shoes of that person. They hear that Trump is racist, so they turn to their source to find ou about it and they come away with:

"People say Trump is racist because he is against illegal immigration, but that's not actually racist because he is fine with legal immigration, he's even married to an immigrant"

"People say he's misogynistic because of a secret recording of some random locker room talk that he had with his buddy over 10 years ago" "How can he be misogynistic when he employees so many women?"

This is how the explanations are presented to them and that's how they look at it.
