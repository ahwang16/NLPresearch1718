I think that millennials have done a great deal of harm in more broadly redefining things like homophobia, xenophobia and so on. To me personally, as long as my voting is mostly consistent with my ideals that's enough to satisfy the idea that I am not any of those things.

I think my last sentiment in this discussion is the following: How can you expect someone to vote alturistically when you probably aren't doing it yourself?
