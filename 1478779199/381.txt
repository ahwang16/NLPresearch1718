I find this very interesting but it's too simplistic to conclude that Trump would have won (even though it looks indeed promising for him). One issue is that you are double counting people. Some people voted for Obama and Trump, so you would have to find that out and try to find a way to allocate them to one candidate (e.g. a black person that voted for Trump and Obama would probably still rather vote for Obama if they would directly compete). There is also the issue of third parties as their candidates obviously changed and voters might have moved.

Another issue is that you are ignoring demographic shifts and the change in age. We know that 2012 youth liked Obama but we don't know whether this is still true in 2016. Or maybe Obama would have taken more of the first time voters that went to Trump (angry Bernie bros?)?

Even if you knew that e.g. 5% of the people in Pennsylvania voted for Obama in 2012 but voted for Trump in 2016 then it's still unclear how to allocated them. They might have voted for Trump because they didn't like Hillary but would have preferred Obama over Trump.

Also it could be that some people that didn't vote for Obama in 2012 would have voted for him vs. Trump.
