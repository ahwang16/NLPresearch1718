The thing is, we get that. But regardless of a supporter's intentions the result is the same. Trump is no less in power because any given supporter disagrees with some of his policies, nor does it mean that he won't try to enact those policies. Moderate supporters don't make for a moderate Trump. Moderate support isn't the silver lining you think it is because extreme candidates don't require extreme supporters.
