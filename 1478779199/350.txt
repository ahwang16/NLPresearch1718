> The idea that the party should be able to take steps to prevent non members from deciding who their candidate will be is at a minimum not one you can dismiss out of hand. I think the specifics can certainly be debated, but claiming any attempt by the DNC to make sure only or mostly Democrats voted in the primary is rigging seems very silly.

This is what I disagree with most. They need "non members" to win general elections, but have no interest in their opinions when it comes time to decide who will be the best candidate for the general election. This practice favors establishment candidates, which was Clinton this cycle.

Republicans have their reasons for voter ID as well. Its to prevent voter impersonation. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest there is a systematic issue with voter impersonation. It is way clearer that the practice systematically disqualifies minority voters, but that's not the reason they give. Just the same, Democrats will tell you non democrats shouldn't be deciding their elections. However, there is no evidence to suggest that non democrats would use these primaries to rig the election. I just don't see what the value of ensuring "non members" don't vote when it disqualifies so many interested parties in the first place.

Its not a case of the DNC planning out an easy path for Hillary Clinton to win the primary over Bernie Sanders. Its the DNC creating a primary system that gives preference to the establishment candidate. It does so with tactics like early voter registration cutoff, super-delegates, and the electoral college-esque system. Hillary Clinton just happens to be this cycles establishment candidate.
