It's not that it should be required to be more fair but rather that the party should fully support the chosen candidate in the general but should be unbiased in the primaries because that's internal. If they are seen to be favoring one over the other that biases the voters which in turn hurts the neutrality of the election. Affecting the neutrality of it is rigging the election. 

You seem to have a very defined view of rigging it as making sure Hilary won. That's not necessary to the claims being made that she rigged it. By giving talking points to pro-hilary camps, including her, they are hurting one side and promoting the other you are pushing the results one way when they shouldn't be. The question isn't whether or not they can but that they should. 

Again just because they didn't break the law doesn't mean what they did was right
