> Australia just fines those who don't. 

And if you don't pay it, then what?

EDIT: My point isn't that you're *literally* putting guns to people's heads at a ballot box, but *at some point in the chain*, if I don't pay the fine, if I refuse a court summons, if I continue to refuse to acknowledge their right to mandate my vote or face a penalty, there is a person with a gun telling me to comply.
