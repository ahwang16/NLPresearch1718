So, you're probably right that gay marriage isn't going away in the next few years. To do  so would require a reversal in the supreme court or a constitutional amendment, neither of which seems likely. However, this isn't the area that might be most effected by a Trump presidency. To the contrary, other areas where we have been making progress, such as anti-discrimination laws and hate crime protections, are likely to stagnate, if not backslide, in the next few years. For LGBT Americans who want to live free of the very real fears of economic disenfranchisement and violence, this is a significant setback.

It's also worth noting that the transgender community, which has started making civil rights gains far more recently, is going to be even more severely effected. Not only do these individuals run the risk of being effected by the issues already mentioned, but they could be impacted very adversely by changes to healthcare laws, which might further limit access to badly needed medical resources.
