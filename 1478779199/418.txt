Alright, this seems to be the crux of your issue, so I'll break it down for you:

Obamacare- Republicans have been trying to pass legislation to kill Obamacare since literally its inception. One of the major things stopping it was a President that wouldn't sign and the lack of a super-majority to overturn a veto. But now they have a Republican controlled House, Senate, and White House and they can pass whatever legislation they want.

Gay rights are dead- Probably hyperbolic, but since the President gets to nominate Supreme Court Justices there is a very real chance that things like Gay Marriage could be rolled back. Not only that but it's unlikely that future gay rights issues (and other LGBTQ issues, don't forget trans people) brought before the court are going to fall in favor of them. There's a lot more to fight for than just marriage, like employment and housing discrimination.

Civil rights are dead- We've already seen this with the stripping of the voting rights act (and oh hey, fewer people voted for Clinton than voted for Obama...wonder if those voter suppression tactics worked). But the bottom line here is that with control over the *entire Federal Government* Republicans are now able to enact almost anything they want.

So no, there isn't some grand mandate. But Trump and Republicans don't need one. All they need is to be in control, and well there you have it.
