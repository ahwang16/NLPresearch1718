CMV:PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS SHOULD BE EQUALLY, IF NOT MORE, CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS WHO ELECTED HIM, MORE SO THAN TRUMP HIMSELF.

Well one huge problem with this country is that we are becoming increasingly segregated. I don't personally know anyone who voted for Trump (not even casually). I know from Facebook that some people back home voted for him, but the people I remained in contact with from back home voted mostly third party. I don't think people can be that angry because we've separated ourselves from each other, both geographically and on the Internet largely. That probably isn't a good thing but I have no idea how it could be fixed.
