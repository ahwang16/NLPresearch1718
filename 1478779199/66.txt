Some are saying that if your motivation to vote for the racist/sexist is not his based on his policies but based on your attempt to prevent the worse evil (the other candidate), you are not racist/sexist yourself.
I generally like this argument and have my view changed partially. However, this is kinda only true in a two-party system like in the US. So if there is ANY other way to prevent the other candidate, you are still supporting sexism/racism.
Morever this approach does not attack the validity of my argument. By my logic voting for Trump to avoid Clinton would still make you sexist/racist, although you might have good intentions.
