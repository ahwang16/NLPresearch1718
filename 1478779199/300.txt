This election showed that right now, certain votes don't count. If one district in California voted overwhelmingly Republican, their votes didn't afffect the outcome of their state, and therefore the national election. Same for a pocket of Blue in Arkansas.  

If all 435 districts counted equally and independently, there would no longer be an incentive to focus solely on Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania, and every citizen will have the same chance to affect the election. 

The fact that Hillary won the popular vote, while losing the election, is emblematic of the current problem, "running up the score" in blue states, which, after 50.01%, no longer affect the totals at all.
