Not OP, but there's a way we can break up the vote to make gerrymandering not an issue. Rather than congressional districts, you can break it up by popular vote. If a state has 5 votes, you can give out 1 vote for each 20% a candidate earns. 

In larger states, it'd be easier for 3rd party candidates to get votes, and everyone's vote would be more valuable
