> Humans aren't causing anything, we're accelerating a natural process. Since we didn't start it, we can't end it, it's out of our control even if we try. Also, moving to and colonizing Mars before it gets to hot here is a pretty cool idea I want to be a part of.

That's ridiculous. We are releasing levels of carbon into the atmosphere at a rate unprecedented since the impetus for the Permian extinction. We are burning some of the greatest carbon sinks on Earth. Mischaracterizing the situation is not a serious argument. 

Ironically, you are convincing me more and more that this is inevitable by exemplifying the human trait which scares me the most -- arrogance and casual disregard of danger that is not immediate. 

Further, you are wasting my time by disregarding my request not to make foolish arguments against the reality of climate change caused by human activity. For that reason I will not be continuing this conversation.

I will close by saying that I am not trying to convince you that you are an idiot. To the contrary, I am trying to convince you that you are wrong and being foolish about something quite serious. If you were an idiot, that would be wasted effort. It is with the presumption that you are not an idiot that I ask you to do the one thing an idiot could never do, which is to detach yourself from opinions you've already formed and coldly reevaluate them in light of the best available evidence.

Take care.
