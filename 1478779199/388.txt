No, math requires assumptions. You are assuming that people who voted for Obama but didn't vote for Hillary would have also not voted for Obama. This assumption flies in the face of the fact that Obama has shown no sign of being unpopular with his previous supporters while these same supporters have been vocally saying they don't like Clinton for the last year.
