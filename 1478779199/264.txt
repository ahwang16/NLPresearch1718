First off, you're trying to convince an idiot of their own stupidity and to change it, everyone knows that an idiot is too stupid to comprehend the extent of their own stupidity. But it's nice that you try.

But yeah, extinction is just a natural event that is out of our control. Even if we try, or have been trying, there is no way we can avoid the unavoidable: death. This is the main reason NASA is working, has been working, on getting man on Mars. Not in search of life, but to put life there, in the form of Humans. 

What people do to nature is nothing outside of what life does period. Living things break complex things into simpler ones. Plants into fossils, fossils into coal, coal into oil, oil into gas, gas into car exhaust. We can't stop this process, because we didn't start it. Without Humans this event would have still happened, just slower. The rapid advancement of Humans have accelerated this process, indirectly and directly. 

To wrap this up:
Humans aren't causing anything, we're accelerating a natural process.
Since we didn't start it, we can't end it, it's out of our control even if we try.
Also, moving to and colonizing Mars before it gets to hot here is a pretty cool idea I want to be a part of.
