The Presidential election was very close - Clinton appears to have won the popular vote while losing the Electoral College. Also, turnout appears to be down significantly from 2008 and 2012, especially on the Democratic side. Opinion polls have consistently shown that trustworthiness has been Clinton's biggest negative. 

I believe that the depressed turnout and the negative perception of Clinton was magnified by the leaks of DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails. These leaks were timed to have maximum impact on the election (DNC leaks around the convention and Podesta e-mails over the last month), and they fed into a narrative that Clinton was corrupt and untrustworthy, that both candidates were terrible, and that it was not worth voting. Trump and the Republican Party capitalized on this narrative by running a campaign against "Crooked Hillary."

Now many people already had an impression of Hillary as a corrupt insider, but it would not have taken much to sway this election - literally a few hundred thousand votes in a few states. Voter turnout was worst among young voters who had helped drive Obama to wins in 2008 and 2012 but largely supported Bernie in the primaries and then stayed at home or voted third party on Tuesday - obviously not all of them or even a large majority, but enough to make a difference. 

The e-mail leaks discouraged and demoralized liberal and progressive voters of all ages who otherwise would have confidently voted for an extension of Obama's agenda or enthusiastically voted for Trump. It allowed some moderate Republicans who may have been disgusted by Trump's behavior to hold their nose and vote against Clinton. 

I believe that the leaks swayed enough votes for Trump to win, which means that hackers (possibly supported by a foreign government) have decided the Presidential election in my country. That scares me. 

Please CMV.
