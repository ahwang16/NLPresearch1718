> There is little reason to think that we're going to permanently damage the climate in the next 4-8 years of a trump presidency, yes hundreds of species will go extinct, and yes that's a tragedy, but will the environment become completely destroyed? That's unlikely.

That's misrepresenting the problem. We've been doing incredible damage for a long time. The question is not how much damage we do over the next four years. The question is whether we can mitigate and cease the damage we're doing in time that, with recovery efforts, we can escape causing a mass extinction event.

We're already in the endgame. We cannot afford to blunder away opportunities this late. The problem is that we need to have the foresight to prevent problems even with lots of short term incentives to make them worse. 

Intelligence grows by degree. First it is about learning the most economical methods of exploiting natural resources and remaking the world around you in your own image. The proposition is, this type of intelligence advances at those endeavors naturally creates conditions which cause mass extinction events, and to prevent those consequences -- to have the foresight and wisdom to take the measures necessary to preserve our own existence -- takes a *leap* of intelligence so great and so unlikely that it is the great filter. It is the answer to the Fermi Paradox, and we're staring it in the face now. 

> TL,DR: Trump's going to be bad for the environment, but it's unlikely that we're all going to die die as a result.

See the closing remark of my post:

> > The election of Trump is not the cause of this, or even a major event. It may be an impetus for this post but that's not what I'm saying at all. We're all fucked, not because of who Trump is, but because of what humanity is. We're both too smart and too stupid for our own good.
