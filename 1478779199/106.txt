Premise 1. I reject. On sexism the infamous tape 'they let you do it'. Further we have the 1989 Savvy Woman magazine in November. On Race Trump has said illegal imigrants are 'rapists, murders etc. some of them are good people'. Now from my undedrstanding of US immigration law anyone convicted of rape or murder isn't allowed to enter, fair enough. This means if one wishes to enter but has such a conviction they'd do it illegally. Hence a venn digram would likley show that illegal immigrants have a higher rate of being both illegal immigrants and rapists, or murderers. On Islam, Trumps refinded speech of 'total ban' of 'ban on countries with high rates of extrermism', again fair enough.   
  
For arguments sake I'll grant the first premise.  
  
Premise 2. I reject yet again. Supporting a racist on a racist policy would make you a racist. Supporting a racist on a 'arace' issue has no impact of race. Same with other forms of bigotory.  
  
Premise 3. This follows my rejection of the first. You supporting a candidate for certain policies isn't support of all their policies and aslong as the support isn't on x issue that is racist the support isn't racist.  
  
Uneducated white males or blue collar workers are hurting. We have similar problems in the UK. Steel workers are struggling from cheap steel from China. Port Talbot produced the worlds finest steel yet from a cost shitty Chinnes is 'better'. The US blue collar worker face similar polices to this made worse by the US' trade deals with nations like China. The left has also abondoned these people, likely taking their vote for grant, to move towards gender indentity and racial identity politics. The working class don't care for these issues.   
  
Another reason Hillary got less votes is Clinton. #1#Even Jeb realised it was [stupid]#1#(http://www.who2.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jeb-sign.jpeg). Not Bush (III), not Jeb Bush but Jeb. The families have bad conitations. Further we have Hillary's scandals. The biggest I think is the Clinton Foundation and their corrupt actions, her daughters wedding isn't what I see as a charatible cause.  
  
Unfourtunatly the US use one of the shitist system imaginable to man and given it is a de facto 2 party state (I don't recall a third party even wining a county though the BBC didn't focus on counties I still don't recall them winning a single one. This means the vote for most comes to the least worse. One can easily argue Trump is the least worse candidate when compared to Clinton whilist rejecting his 'out there' speeches and polices. If I lived in the US I'd vote Trump if I lived in a swing state or in Maine or Coneticut if I could influence the district. If I was in a safe Democrat seat I'd vote Johnson. If I lived in a write in state I'd but Berine. My personal politcal view is, Liberal-Socialist, Republican (-3.88,-2.87) Leave (note republican means anti-monarchy in the UK and leave is support for Brexit).
