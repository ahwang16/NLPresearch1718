Under the system you propose the President-Elect could still recieve less votes than the losing candidates. For this you'll just need to get 50.1% of the vote in 218 districts and the 217 doesn't matter. The elction will follow the same route with a few districts being the swing districts and many disticts being solid red or blue. All this really would do is change it from 50 to 435.  
  
While your critique is correct it is your solution that is wrong to fix the problem as you see it.  
  
What America should do is count each ballot as one. When a polling station declares the result the votes for each candidate are added straight to the national 'pot'. The votes should either be done how they are now and have FPTP as the election system or they should be numbered and use AV. This way the President will always be the most popular voted candiate and with AV will always exceed 50% even if it takes a few rounds.
