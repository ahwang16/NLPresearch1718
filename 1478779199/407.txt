The concern is that we are increasingly becoming trapped in our echo chambers. It's hard to understand each other and work together when we don't interact in a day to day way. This has created a political polarization that includes consuming different media and believing different narratives. It's good to have your views challenged. It's good to see what other people struggle with.
