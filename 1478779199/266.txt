There are some things that we unquestionably agree on.  The EPA being headed by a climate change denier is a travesty, and things are about to get worse for the environment.  I don't really think there's a debate to be had on that count.

Is a mass extinction coming?  I'd probably argue that it's already here, but that would be quibbling over semantics.  

Are we screwed?  I wouldn't be so sure.  There is little reason to think that we're going to permanently damage the climate in the next 4-8 years of a trump presidency, yes hundreds of species will go extinct, and yes that's a tragedy, but will the environment become completely destroyed?  That's unlikely.  

Furthermore, technology improves exponentially.  Maybe a device that could undue global warming is inconceivable.  Thirty years ago the internet was inconceivable.  Sixty years ago, a space station was inconceivable. 

TL,DR:  Trump's going to be bad for the environment, but it's unlikely that we're all going to die die as a result.
