This sort of thing has always been an issue. In order to maintain this whole 'free market' that America has, the government has to have absolute minimum intervention with corporate entities. Which has proven to be a bit of a problem, FDA versus GMO's for example. If you want to change how people run their businesses, you have to do so in a very indirect way. 
I completely agree with you, I just think it's a lot harder to tell corporations what to do versus telling immigrants what to do.
