Not really object of my CMV but I disagree that 100% employment will be possible on a global or even developed world scale. 

If everyone were a skilled worker we still wouldn't have enough jobs for them all.

UBI accounts for that reality, it also provides people with the freedom to pursue endeavors that aren't inherently financially gainful. UBI is often said to unlock human creativity and I believe it will.

Lastly I do not believe in letting people starve to death, ever. If the money I create helps prop up lazy people so be it, I have no problem with that. 

However I do find your solution appealing, I'm not sure it's a perfect solution but it is an alternative to UBI.

If you can sway me more on why it could actually work on a global scale I'd be ready to delta.
