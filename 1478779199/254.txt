Saying your concerned about something on a survey takes no effort and is worth nothing. 

> "Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?

> Yes...

> Are you gonna build them?

> No.

> Then what good was the yes?"

I'm not impressed with the reaction, and I don't think you're impressed with the level of threat. What I see is the human race on the precipice of total disaster and instead of trying to solve problems like there's a fire under our ass we're just getting around to thinking we might have a problem. And while some people are motivated to solve it, a **lot** more people are every bit as motivated to make it worse, and those people have a shit ton of money and influence.
