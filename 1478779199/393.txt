Trump has received less total votes than Romney overall. He falls 6 million votes short of Obama in 2012. Moreover, Obama was strongest in the states that matter and actually weaker than Hillary in states that aren't really contested (like Texas). It's hard to imagine any scenario where Trump beat Obama who will probably leave office with the highest approval of any president leaving office since Reagan.
