I tend to agree that the influence of the economy on election results might be overstated .

However following this line of thinking leads back to blaming those population groups for voting based on "racism, xenophobia, etc." and not taking their concerns seriously.

Based on this year, I am done with doing that. Maybe it's not as bad as populists would have us believe. But ignoring it completely is what brought us here. Many people state that they voted based on economic and trade policy, that they want their life improved.

I do not believe we can convince these people without offering a solution like protectionist movements do. And to me that solution would be UBI as I do not see another.

In so far, your argument failed to change my view on the question whether UBI is the only reasonable solution to offer people as a hope for change. Again I never stated necessarily that offering a UBI might sway an election, only that it is the only reasonable instrument left to try.
