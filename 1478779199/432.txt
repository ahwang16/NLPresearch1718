First of all, I agree with your overall sentiment that the jobs Trump is promising to bring back are gone, and they're never coming back. However, what I have issue with is this statement?

> In the face of ever increasing global integration and the development of the economy and labor market, we should accept that gainful employment will no longer be accessible to everyone.

I would replace the word 'gainful' with 'unskilled', and then you have a point. As in, working a 9-5 where you simply do a job that anybody with two weeks of training could do will not be a choice as a career option anymore. Because what isn't currently being done by cheap labor will soon be done by machines. However, I don't think a permanent 'sit on your ass and do nothing' meal ticket is the answer. As in, I'm not going to go to work every day just to provide for some jerkoff who wants to do nothing but lay around playing video games all day, eating chips off his chest.

On the other hand, I recognize that people without any marketable skills are going to need some help. (And in some cases, some therapy.) So what I would propose is, instead of giving them a lifetime of UBI, give them the training they need to compete in today's economy. There's still going to be PLENTY of jobs out there that automation can't handle... you just have to have some education behind you. Maybe not a 4 year college degree, but perhaps specialized trade schools for things that are in high demand. 

So yeah, I'm willing to help them out through this process. But at some point, if you want to eat, you've gotta go out and earn your keep like the rest of us. Otherwise, you can starve to death for all I care. (Note: I am not talking about people here who CAN'T work, for whatever reason.)
