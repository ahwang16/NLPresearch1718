The Constitution gives the Federal government the power to regulate elections explicitly, as well as the states. 

Things like the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, Help America Vote Act, National Voter Registration Act, among others have all exercised the power. 

In addition, 4 out of the 16 Amendments proposed after the Constitutional Convention regard voting rights.

The precedent of voting as a federal issue is there from a legislative point of view.
