> My issue with the idea that the election is rigged is that this paints a picture of the DNC working specifically to promote one candidate over the other.

Although it wasn't a specific rule change for this election, I feel one thing worth noting is that, the whole reason the Democratic party has super delegates was to include votes from Democratic leadership.   From Wikipedia:  

>Further soul-searching took place among party leaders, who argued that the pendulum had swung too far in the direction of primary elections over insider decision-making...resulting in the nomination of unelectable candidates. A new 70-member commission headed by Governor of North Carolina Jim Hunt was appointed to further refine the Democratic Party's nomination process, attempting to balance the wishes of rank-and-file Democrats with the collective wisdom of party leaders and to thereby avoid the nomination of insurgent candidates exemplified by the liberal McGovern or the anti-Washington conservative Carter and lessening the potential influence of single-issue politics in the selection process.  

So the DNC has superdelegates that aren't bound to go along with any voting records.  Hillary may have one the nomination had superdelegates not been the case, but the regular delegate count was 2205-1846 with Hillary leading, but the superdelegate count was 602-48 for Hillary.  

So while I wouldn't necessarily call it rigged, the DNC does have a way to select a candidate against the votes of the people in primaries/caucuses to a certain degree.
