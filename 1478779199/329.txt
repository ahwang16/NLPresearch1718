CMV: I DON'T THINK THE DNC RIGGED THE ELECTION AGAINST BERNIE

So, this is a tough one, because I am not saying that you can't criticize things done by the DNC. I also realize we can get into trouble with interpretations of "rigged."  So what do I mean?

I mean that the DNC did not pursue actions to favor specifically Hillary over specifically Bernie to any degree that affected the outcome of the primary.

What I don't mean.

The DNC did not have rules in place that benefit an establishment candidate over another. You can not feel that actions and rules of the DNC were stupid.

My issue with the idea that the election is rigged is that this paints a picture of the DNC working specifically to promote one candidate over the other. In reality, the rules were known beforehand and Bernie and his supporters dropped the ball on following them.

For example, many people complain about the deadline to register as a Democrat. While the complaints that it is unreasonable can certainly be valid, the rules weren't suddenly changed to hurt Sanders, which is the picture painted when it is called rigged.

For that matter, closed versus open primaries. While there are valid arguments that primaries should be open or semi open, you can not deny that there are good arguments for leaving a primary closed in order to let people who have declared themselves Democrats to vote on which Democrat they want, and especially to not let Republicans have a say. I actually stand on the side of semi-closed primaries as best, but I think it is silly to call it rigged.

Voter supression. The primaries are run by the states and the places with the most voter supression are states run by Republicans. Anyone who was angry at the DNC about long lines in a place like Arizona outs themselves as having no clue what they are talking about.

Hillary won nearly 3.8 million more votes than Sanders did, with a total count of 27.8 million; so over 10% of the total. More importantly, she cemented the bulk of her lead on Super Tuesday, when her lead became so great that every primary from that point on Sanders had to win what, 60% of the vote at least just to stay *even*, and every primary he didn't win by that much he needed to win future ones even more decisively. Can you honestly tell me that the DNC rigged it so that Bernie lost by these amounts?

A few more notes on arguments I have heard so far that don't I press me.

Emails pertaining to discussions by DNC members that show bias, such as the question about Sanders' religious beliefs. I think we run into a painfully obvious problem here that he wasn't asked about it. You can certainly argue that the DNC members showing any bias even in private was unprofessional, but people having discussion in private emails does not equate to rigging.

I have also seen people bringing up the DNC acting as though Hillary had already won in May....except she basically had. Frankly the race was over after Super Tuesday without a miracle, and by May that miracle was clearly not coming. At this point if the DNC wanted the best chance at winning the General, they should have pushed far harder than they did to get rid of Bernie. Of course that would have played even more into the image of rigging, and so they let him continue to attack the DNC itself, and let his supporters have a platform to make accusations of rigging.

So, what would it take to change my mind? Frankly evidence that early on the DNC took concrete steps that can be shown to have actually happened to push Hillary over Bernie. Frankly anything done after Super Tuesday would have to be momumental.

Thanks
