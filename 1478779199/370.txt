In Homeward the decision was forced on him by Worf's brother who teleports them onto the enterprise, in Pen Pals, they find a loophole.

>Picard announces that they will obey the Prime Directive and leave the system. Picard orders Data to cut the transmission with Sarjenka, but Data plays a transmission from her, where she pleads them to help her planet. Upon hearing this, Picard decides that since it is a direct plea for help, the Prime Directive no longer applies. The crew cannot simply turn their backs on the inhabitants now. 

He doesn't purposely violate it. Worf's brother and Data in each episode manage to find a way to force him to violate it.
