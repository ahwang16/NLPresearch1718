>It certainly isn't pretty, but this is normal talk. I just graduated college and I would hear things 10x worse than this on a daily basis. Show me an occasion where trump has either been proven guilty in court of law or irrefutable evidence of sexist actions. 

It really isn't normal in many people's experience. We're just swapping anecdotes here, but yours doesn't discount mine. Plenty of men feel that kind of talk is despicable, which is a valid challenge to OP's first premise. 

>CMV is not a place for personal attacks

That's not a personal attack, or an insult, it's an assessment of belief. If you think that a man discussing "grabbing a woman by the pussy" is in any way acceptable, then yes, you hold misogynistic beliefs. Full stop.
