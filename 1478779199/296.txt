Trump is going to have a lot of power over the Supreme Court, which historically has had a lot of sway over civil rights issues. The problem here is that gay marriage could be rolled back by the court, but in addition to that LGTBQ rights issues (especially employment and housing discrimination) won't be addressed in Congress, signed by the President, and again might not be upheld by the Supreme Court.

Not only that, but Trump's win has galvanized the bigoted section of America that was pushing for him. And a galvanized bigot who believes their views are justified in light of the recent election might not be the best thing in the world for marginalized groups. It isn't like violence against LGBTQ individuals is rare or unheard of, and that was before the person they wanted to become President was elected.
