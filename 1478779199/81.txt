If you are white and you support policies that benefit you directly over someone who isn't white (your words here because in the sample you said the policies are racist) then yes, you are a racist. You view your financial gain as more important than equal access. 

Trump supporters were willing to look past the bigotry for the chance at financial gain and the reality is because they aren't affected by it. I can understand the desire to "blow up the establishment" but doing it without regard for the groups that will be the kindling is terrible.
