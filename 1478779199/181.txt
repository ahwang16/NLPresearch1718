>Aren't they paying taxes and likely granted various permits or licenses depending on what industry they are in?

Nope.  Businesses that are set up as sole proprietorships or simple partnerships often don't file any paperwork with the state and their taxes are filed on a personal return.  There is no way to know how many of these businesses there are or where they are located.

That is why I say its hard to police it at a business level.
