CMV: IF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE TAKING AMERICAN JOBS, AND THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM, WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER THE ENTITIES EMPLOYING THE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.

I would just like to say that when I was in high school I worked at a construction material distributor as the ordering guy. 

One of the guys I sold to was busted by ICE for employing undocumented workers. He was arrested, they were let go. 

The guy took advantage of cheap labor and got punished. Now they are out there doing it to another bloke. 

My disagreement so my post doesn't get taken off is that not only should those people be fined, but the undocumented workers should be sent back to where they came from.

You have no right to be here without legalpapers, regardless of what people say. And you don't get to jump legal immigrants because you broke the law.
