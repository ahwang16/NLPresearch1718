If everyone were a skilled worker, people could create jobs for themselves. It's really not that hard... just learn how to do something people want to pay you money for. Hell, some people are making fat cash by creating memes on the Internet. I remember not so long ago, some kid sold a iPhone app he wrote to Yahoo for like $30 million.

Mind you, I'm not an economist... I'm not entirely certain it would work. I'm just presenting an alternative here.

That's fine, but understand that some people (a lot of people, actually) would be vehemently opposed to it. So, what do you plan to do about those of us who are rioting in the streets because we have to go out and bust our asses every day to provide for lazy people?
