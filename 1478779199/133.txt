>Saying =/= doing

I'm not saying he grabbed a woman by the pussy. I'm saying he *bragged* about grabbing women by the pussy. That act is misogynistic. 

I'm not saying he *is* a misogynist. I'm saying what he *did* is misogynist.

>Misogyny can not be determined by one action. It is a series of actions and beliefs that women are worse than men. Donald Trump makes fun of EVERYONE, not just women. That's his shtick. 

From the **very article you've linked to**;

>Here's the thing, though. It wasn't sexist. Donald Trump, **despite legitimate charges of sexism in other instances**, has said the exact same thing about men on multiple occasions--specifically Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).
