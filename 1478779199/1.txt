CMV: THE CURRENT STATE OF POLITICAL DISCUSSION MAKES IT POINTLESS TO SERIOUSLY DISCUSS POLITICS ON THE INTERNET.

I would offer this very sub as a counterpoint - throughout this election we have had very civil, well informed discussions about both candidates (albeit more democratic leaning just due to Reddit's natural demographics).  Vitriolic discussion has been shut down by the mod team and only level headed discussion allowed to remain.

The internet allows for echo-chamber discussions to be certain, but its not _impossible_ to find civil discourse on the internet.  It just takes communities like this one who commit to that ideal and this can and does happen.
