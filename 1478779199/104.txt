Well, the problem I'm try to expose in your second premise is that it has no allowance for nuance, or for people who voted Trump in spite of, not because of, any bigotry on his part. 

If supporting someone who is homophobic makes me a homophobe, then eating at Chick-fil-A makes me just as homophobic as shooting up a pride parade chanting "God hates fags". 

I'd vote Trump even if he vowed to "have all those fags stoned in the streets", no matter how much that stance is anathema to me, because I believe more people would die in WW3 than Trump could ever possibly get the US gov't to kill based on sexual orientation.
