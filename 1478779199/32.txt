CMV: MANDATORY VOTING IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS A GREAT IDEA.

Here's part of the problem I see with this:

whenever the government says "mandatory", that's a threat of violence. It absolutely has to be, otherwise it isn't mandatory, it's just strongly suggested. Taxes are mandatory, because if you don't pay them, at some point of not paying them, people with guns will come and force them out of you.

I am very happy to ask other people to vote, and to vote myself, given the current system.

I am not happy to hold a gun to someone's head and tell them to vote or die. Part of me really wants to believe that I'd have the nuts to tell someone with a gun to my head, saying vote or die, to pull the trigger... but I know that I don't know what I'd do until I got in that situation. Most likely I'd just draw a dick on the ballot.

If you want to *encourage* voting, offer a barbecue and a moonbounce or something, don't use the threat of force to coerce a vote.
