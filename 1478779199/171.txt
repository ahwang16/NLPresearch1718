Climate change deniers, like anti-vaxxers and creationists, either haven't seen the overwhelming evidence, or are in denial despite the overwhelming evidence.  Those in the former category can be reasoned with, and that also includes people who accept climate change, but deny its level of significance.  But those in the later category cannot be reasoned with because they already have heard the evidence and reject it.  They will cover their ears and ignore reason.  Those are the people I am calling ignorant.  That group includes Trump himself as well as some of his supporters (but not all I'm sure).



Someone who accepts climate change and thinks we should give it zero priority because we can let other countries deal with it is selfish and also ignorant and anti-patriotic because if the world leader "great" US isn't leading environmentalism, who will?



There are people who can be reasoned with, but there are people who can't, and those people are ignorant, and the includes the man himself.
