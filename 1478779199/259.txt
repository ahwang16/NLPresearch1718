> I'm unsure of whether you are referring to the elimination of humans or all the other species that aren't humans.

I'm talking about a mass extinction, like the Permian extinction in which 95% of all species went extinct. 

> And why won't humans be able to overcome the warming climate and changing weather patterns?

I don't see any basis for thinking we will be able to do things like that in time. Assuming we could, there is still a problem. As our ability to do good expands so does our ability to wreak havoc, only the latter is always a few steps ahead of the former. So if the overall capabilities of humankind expanded to clean up the mess we have created so far, it would also create new problems beyond even those expanded capabilities. 

> During the Permian-Triassic extinction event, the only option they had was evolution.

When the oceans reach a certain level of acidity, that is where mass extinction begins. It doesn't matter if humans are able to adapt faster than biological evolution if the food chain required for our continued existence is utterly destroyed. 

This is all happening faster than our ability to exist without the ecosystems of this planet which we are rapidly destroying. 

------------

More than all this, in order to solve these problems we would have to recognize they exist and start actually trying to solve them. Right now that is not a consensus that can be reached, but everyone understands that there is money to be made in devastating the ecology of our planet. It isn't that we're not moving fast enough; it's that we're moving very fast in the wrong direction with no signs of slowing.
