CMV:PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS SHOULD BE EQUALLY, IF NOT MORE, CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS WHO ELECTED HIM, MORE SO THAN TRUMP HIMSELF.

More people voted for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump. Protesting is a continued outreach to the majority of voters who did not want Donald Trump elected. 

Also, being against Donald Trump is not the same as being against those who voted for him. I can empathize with some of the reasons people chose him over Hillary Clinton. But there is still a lot about Donald Trump that is dangerous and it makes sense for me to combat those aspects.

If Hillary Clinton won, and people were protesting her, I would not view it as a personal attack. There are plenty of reasons to have hated her as president. But I voted for her because I thought a Donald Trump presidency would be worse.
