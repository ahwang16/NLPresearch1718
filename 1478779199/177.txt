Sadly, you'd be surprised...

Many, many years ago, I lived in a very shady part of my city.  Next door, there was a one bedroom apt where 6 illegal men lived.  They didn't do much beyond work and hang out in the apt - all of the extra money they earned they sent back home to their families in Mexico.  They were doing it so their wives and children could have a better life.

Those men would probably have lived locked in a basement if it meant that cash kept flowing back home.
