Donald Trump was elected largely on his unprecedented support of violence against minorities, including the GLBTQ community.  His rhetoric has directly led to a big uptick in hate crimes throughout his campaign and he doesn't look like he's going to take his foot off the pedal.  It will probably get worse when he's sworn into office and can affect the legality of hate crimes. 

He and his VP openly support conversion therapy and there are very real concerns having control of the House, Senate, and Supreme Court will lead to laws forcing the GLBTQ community to undergo that "therapy".
