Not if you allow abstaining on the ballot. Then voting is no more a violation of free speech than the draft or filing your income taxes etc.

Edit: So basically this November you could have had a ballot like this:

President:

A) Donald Trump

B) Hillary Clinton

C) Gary Johnson

D) Jill Stein

E) Write In

F) None of the Above

Etc. for all of the down ballot candidates.
