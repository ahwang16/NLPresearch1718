Tie expansion of opening up trade to the change-over-time standard-of-living of whoever is getting panicky about it.  Target a given rate (could be negative, zero, or positive).

That more-directly addresses their concern ("my standard-of-living may fall due to trade if many people enter the same labor market that I work in") and doesn't involve UBI.
