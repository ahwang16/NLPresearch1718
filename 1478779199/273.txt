Wikileaks didn't create that evidence, they just revealed them to the public.

Also, it's all linked because if DNC primaries were not rigged (as it was revealed in the leaks) it would be very possible that other candidate would be representing democrats and if it was Bernie for example, it would be much more possible for him to win against Trump. That way, there would be no need for Wikileaks to dig into DNC's internal operations.

It's not hackers' fault, it's DNC's fault, hackers would not be needed if everything was fair.
