The example given didn't have anyone affected negatively but did specify that racist policies allowed White people to gain more than non-white people. Supporting that is racist.  

The ACA is a hard example to use here because many states have intervened skewing the premium data. Massachusetts for example is not seeing the premium increases seen elsewhere.
