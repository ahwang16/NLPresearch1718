> Can you provide proof that trumped bribed a attorney general?

He gave $25,000 to an AG that was looking into Trump University, and a month later she announces that he won't be charged. I don't have any leaked emails, but you can connect the dots. This kind of quid pro quo is what releasing taxes would reveal.

> Are you saying that the DNC is not corrupt with what happened?

The only corrupt thing they did was break their own rules and support Clinton. I'd be surprised if the RNC didn't do something similar.
