No, I don't think I do. I don't even know that it is possible for us to survive, if we started taking things seriously. But more to the point, I don't know that it is possible that we will take it seriously until the consequences are already manifest. 

People are heavily invested in improving the situation? Please, quantify those investments. Then let's compare that to investments in coal, petroleum, beef, palm plantations... It's like people talking about the solar revolution has gotten so huge -- so big it's now about 0.8% of power generated in the United States. 

But don't mistake the forest for the trees. What I'm talking about is how intelligence develops. 

Take the following premises: 

* The cumulative intelligence of a species is a term describing its ability to exploit natural resources and reshape its surroundings by its own design.

* Intelligence evolve by degree, not in great leaps.

* A species with high and growing cumulative intelligence will eventually effect the ecosystems of its planet in such a way as to cause a mass extinction event unless it takes active measures to prevent such an event. 

* Strong short term incentives against such active measures will always exist.

**IF**, taking the measures required to prevent a mass extinction event would require a leap in cumulative intelligence, then any intelligent technological species would be unlikely to do so. 

This is an answer to the Fermi Paradox, and I think we might be staring it dead in the face. We're already in the endgame of this scenario and most people -- people like you -- do not think it is a serious situation. "We'll be fine. We'll have plenty of time to adapt." *Bullshit.*

------------------

No, we *will not* adapt to survive a collapse of the food chain from the bottom up, nor will we be able to stop it once it starts. If the massive pockets of methane below the permafrost are released suddenly by a record thaw, we can't stop that. There are all sorts of positive feedback loops we are actively putting in motion, and you are arrogantly and foolishly underestimating how dangerous they are. I'm sorry, but I don't take the proposition that this isn't a dead serious existential threat seriously at all. This post is about me being open to the proposition that it isn't an inevitability. 

Imagine being run over by a steam roller. You're on the ground and it's crushed both of your feet, pointed at your head. If someone sets that thing in motion it doesn't matter how slowly it's going. You are not going to adapt your way out of it.
