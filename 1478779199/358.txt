Like I said, it only makes sense to do in certain instances. You're right, those jobs where somebody makes $5 a day sewing soccer balls with their teeth aren't coming back, nor would we really want them back. 

How about a more specific example? Most US auto manufacturers used to produce their parts in factories in places like Flint, MI or Fort Wayne, IN. Those companies could save money by producing those parts in Mexico instead, so they shut down the factories in the US and built new ones in Mexico. 

If you increase the cost of importing those parts, or decrease the cost of making them in the US (using tax breaks and incentives, which *is* trickle-down economics), it no longer makes economic sense to export those jobs. Companies like GM, Chrysler, and Ford could then re-open some of those factories and put people back to work. That's why places like Flint, Saginaw, and Detroit are so poor now, because those jobs were all moved away. 

Agreements like NAFTA ensure that we can't do that, which is why Trump would logically have to call for a repeal of that agreement. I suppose Mexico could attempt to retaliate with tariffs of their own, but almost 50% of their imported goods come from the USA. Retaliation would affect them way more than us. 

It sucks if you live in Mexico, but that's not really Trump's problem. And while I feel for people in other countries and understand that globalization helps them a lot, I can't really blame an unemployed or underemployed factory worker for putting themselves and their families first.
