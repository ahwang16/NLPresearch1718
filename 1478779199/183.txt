I'm not sure what you mean here.  Its _never_ going to be easy to keep track of the number of illegal workers.  Many of them don't work full time in any one place - they get day jobs as they are needed.  Still others are paid in cash under the table - unless you start raiding every random storefront, you'll never know who is working in the back.
