CMV: IF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE TAKING AMERICAN JOBS, AND THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM, WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER THE ENTITIES EMPLOYING THE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.

First off, let me preface this by saying I don't think illegal immigrants are a significant problem - I think they're a scapegoat for the sudden decline in construction work following the real estate crash, as well as legal outsourcing. I also don't think a wall would be effective at all at keeping out the handful of illegal immigrants that have an ultimately negligible effect on the economy.

That being said, as far as "why can't we just bust the businesses" it's important to remember that the penalty for breaking the law is always *nothing* if you don't get caught. It's like drug dealing - everyone knows the consequences are severe, but everyone believes that they can outsmart the system - and they usually do. It's an arms race - the DEA starts patrolling the border, the drug dealers start using boats. They look for the boats, the drug dealers switch to submarines. Etc.

If we cracked down on businesses using illegal labor, we *still* wouldn't be able to end illegal immigration. Many businesses would inevitability find a way to outsmart the system, and that could even lead to more abusive practices towards immigrants, such as keeping them locked in basements when they're not working.
