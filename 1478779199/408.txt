CMV:PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS SHOULD BE EQUALLY, IF NOT MORE, CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS WHO ELECTED HIM, MORE SO THAN TRUMP HIMSELF.

I live in the Bay Area of California. I'm not concerned with your neighbors. Mine voted overwhelmingly against Trump. 

The problems with our voting system run deep. Uninformed and misinformed voters, no penalty for misstatements by candidates, PACs and campaigns, media that wants to see the race as close as possible so as to boost ratings, voter suppression in red states, gerrymandering, a populus that doesn't understand the very real looming environmental crisis, a rate of technological change that not even the people in silicon valley can keep up with... 

So, no, I'm not just going to accept this. I'm going to fight it any way I can. It may be futile, but at least I'll be able to live with myself.
