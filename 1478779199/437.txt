CMV: UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME OR MEASURES SIMILAR TO IT ARE THE ONLY COUNTER-STRATEGY TO THE POPULIST ANTI-GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT

Globalization is more than purely economic, but the political power and influence it garners, and the cultural shifts it can produce (for better or worse).  People of a demographic want to live a certain way and not another.

UBI/redistribution doesn't change the existing power structure, nor address any of those problems or concerns.  Protectionism in theory could.  But they're not mutually exclusive, which necessarily implies that UBI + something else (some permutation of alternative involving protectionism) may be a superior option of addressing those concerns.

I don't know what solution that might be, but I don't see a logical reason to assume that UBI is the *only* option left and has zero alternatives.
