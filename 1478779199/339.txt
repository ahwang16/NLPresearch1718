>1. do you think that the USA cares about a person's religion?

The USA has, at it's very core, the founding principle of freedom of religion. It falls into our right to privacy.

>2, do you think it is correct for a political party to not find out what their candidate's beliefs are?

I think it's irrelevant what a candidates religion is, but do want to know their moral compass. Religion isn't much of an indicator there. Hitler was a baptised Roman Catholic.

>... play "gotcha" with further questions "but are you a Christian or Jew?"

Because it's a personal thing, there's no game to asking someone to pin point their religion.

>Which leads to my third question. Do you honestly view that question as evidence of the DNC rigging the election against Sanders?

Are you asking me if an email between employees of a "company" (DNC) trying to brainstorm ways of manufacturing and manipulating public perception is evidence of rigging? Yes. Yes it is. It's not their place to create a fight among the candidates, they are specifically charged with being neutral in the process of figuring out who will be able to beat the opposition party, who has greater public support. Figuring out who would be the best candidate is entirely about discussing positions, showing candidates in reality and allowing the registered Dems to pick the best one... they are supposed to never put a "thumb on the scale". There's no question they did. They broke the process.
