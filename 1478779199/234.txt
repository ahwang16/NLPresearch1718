>Okay everyone, I object to using the word illegal to describe an entire group of people.

No one is saying that all Mexicans are illegal. YOU are the one assigning a label on everyone.

Secondly, we are going after these companies. We're going to be closing loopholes with taxes to have funds over seas, and we're going to be making sure that people who immigrate here are citizens. This isn't a hard concept.
