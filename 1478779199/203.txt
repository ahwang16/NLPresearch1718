Then you should support nationwide e-verify, a program that Republicans have previously tried to make mandatory but that Democrats have rejected as being insufficient without """"comprehensive immigration reform.""""

That's the thing people in this debate overlook. There *already is* a way to ensure that employers only hire people legally allowed to work in the US.  We don't need to dedicate effort to "going after" them. We need to expand the worker verification program we already have to universal coverage.
