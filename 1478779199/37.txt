Voting and slavery are two very different things, I think you jumped the shark there my friend.  The Government forces people to pay taxes.  You are forced to sign up for the draft.  You are forced to fill out the census.  Do people opt out of some things?  Yeah.  But in my mind it would be more beneficial to opt out than to opt in to voting.
