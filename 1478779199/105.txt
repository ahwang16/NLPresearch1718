I do not completely understand your Chick-fil-a example but I admit that I'm not differentiating enough. Buying something from a homophobe (and thus "supporting" his homophobia, if you can even call it that) does obviously not make you a homophobe.
But electing someone with homophobic views to the president of the united states will make it likely that his policies will negatively affect gay people. This is on a complete different level than the previous example. I think this supports homophobia to such a degree that its appropriate to call his or her voters homophobes.

Btw I don't judge your decision. It's completely reasonable and probably the ethical choice based on your information.
