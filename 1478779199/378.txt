the colonists would simply become part of the planets life cycle, and since the sentient species evolved after they would not consider the colonists foreign but simply the apex predators.   

the colonists are still able to ignore the newly sentient species as their technology is so much more advanced,  a sentient prey/predator species does not simply walk up to an apex predator species.  

essentially the point is that we become part of the evolutionary cycle before sentient beings exist thus we are part of it when they emerge.

and even if we did have an effect on the sentient population after that it would essentially be the same as the french meeting the dutch,  two separate nationalities who's technological development  isn't exactly the same. 

but essentially it boils down to this,  we don t have to share technology and knowledge simply because we live closer.  with a sufficiently high wall the difference between a ship in space and someone behind that wall is negligible
