- Removing climate restrictions is either selfish (fuck the world money is more important than the enviornment) or ignorant (pollution doesn't matter and climate change is fake)

- Supporting the NSA because you think "it doesn't matter cause I have nothing to hide" is ignorant.  Supporting it for other reasons is pretty similar to anti-gun arguments.  I'm honestly really surprised right-wing people support this.  Seems highly anti-patriotic and anti-American to me.



Selfish and ignorant are exactly the words to describe people who support those policies.



As for your points on the lab grants and vulgarity, fair enough.  (Although he should make sure labs get proper private sector funding rather than just cutting the cord.  We'll see what happens).


Also I don't think your response to his "foreign policy" really answers the question.  He's not "putting America's interests first", his upsetting other countries' leaders with bad jokes.  (Assuming he thinks he is joking, which I'm not fully convinced of).
