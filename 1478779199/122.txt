All three of your premises rely on strawmaned arguments agaisnt Trump, and guilt by association. They are fallacys for a reason.

I would like for you to prove Donald Trump, beyond a reasonable doubt, is a sexist and racist. Meaning that he:

>...believes that a particular race/sex is superior to another.

That is the definition of racism, so we will be using that. If you cannot prove your claim, then you are wrong and are not viewing reality correctly.
