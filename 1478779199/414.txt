CMV:PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS SHOULD BE EQUALLY, IF NOT MORE, CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORS WHO ELECTED HIM, MORE SO THAN TRUMP HIMSELF.

Protesting against something as old and accepted as a presidential election is poor character, instead of accepting the outcome and working together. 

What are they protesting exactly?  The election?  It was fair and square.  I didn't vote for Trump, but the outcome informs me on the general psyche of the American people, which I must accept.

There will always be reasons to dislike both candidates.  It would be utopian to think there will ever be a candidate without any blemishes.  These two were no different in that respect.  But the response of protesting is akin to pouting and stomping your feet because an outcome of a fair and democratic process was not to your liking.
