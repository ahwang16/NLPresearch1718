I don't think everyone who voted for Trump is a sexist/racist. I think a fair percentage are, and I think the rest are happy to turn a blind eye to the social implications of this election for their own personal gain. I don't know where Trump himself falls on this spectrum, but I can't support him either way.

There have always been hate crimes and intolerant people, but Trump has effectively condoned this hate and  intolerance. Maybe he's not racist/sexist and used the implication he was to gain more votes. I don't think the reason he's said what he has matters- it's the impact it has had and will continue to have on our country. He's further divided and segregated us more than we were already, and I think we're in for an extremely difficult decade as a result.
