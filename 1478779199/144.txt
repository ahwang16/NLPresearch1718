That's just ignorant.  Every law that provides special, legal privileges to people who are not white men are institutionally racist and negatively affect white men.  And while there were certainly a percentage of Trump voters who are truly racist or misogynistic, there were also a percentage who were just tired of being told they were perpetrators making victims of everyone else.  And, of course, there was a (likely) majority of Trump voters who didn't even consider racism or sexism in their decision making.
