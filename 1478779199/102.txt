I'll take it one step further than the guy above me. 

My vote for Trump would be based very heavily on Clinton's proposed Syrian no fly zone. As such a move would spark a war with Russia, and I am a healthy male of draftable age, I would really rather that did not happen. That's leaving aside the possibility of a nuclear exchange. 

If I vote for a homophobe so I don't get drafted and nukes don't fly, am I still a bigot?
