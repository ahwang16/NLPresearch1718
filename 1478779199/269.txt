While I agree with your overall premise, there is no evidence thus far that the hackers / leakers *CREATED* or *FALSIFIED* the leaked emails.  That means that what was said was said.  Of course, it was leaked and shown at inopportune times, dropped without context, and trickled out over months to provide a steady drumbeat of distractions.  However, it is ultimately the voters have both the responsibility and accountability for selecting the leader of their country.  Without the private server investigation or the wikileaks hack, the Hillary campaign could have been much more successful at couching her as the brilliant, kindly to her friends, and tough as nails to her opponents grandmother who just wants to serve.  

The biggest difference was the strategy for dealing with leaks, and the image that Hillary was trying to present.  She was trying to have her cake and eat it too.  If as soon as the wikileaks stuff started coming out, she deeply and sincerely apologized to the Sanders campaign, fired Podesta, and kicked Wasserman Schultz to the curb, and started rebuilding her staff anew, the steady trickle of leaks would have been much easier to ignore.  Who cares about emails and rumors and badmouthing between staffers that are no longer with the campaign?  

There were plenty of steps she could have taken to better bring the burned Sanders and Independent voters together, but she chose not to in order to appease her allies and friends.
