CMV: UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME OR MEASURES SIMILAR TO IT ARE THE ONLY COUNTER-STRATEGY TO THE POPULIST ANTI-GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT

Brexit, Trump and anti-globalization movements around the world show that huge parts of the population feel left behind by the economy, globalization and the elites that profit from both.

In their - justified - anger they turn to the only movements and political leaders that promise to do something about it.

And while I 100% understand the needs and worries of those people, I personally do not believe that protectionism is the answer. Manual labor is never coming back to developed nations and we will never see 0% unemployment again.

Established partys often seem like a globalist conspiracy because they both believe this to be true as well. So what can be done?

In the face of ever increasing global integration and the development of the economy and labor market, we should accept that gainful employment will no longer be accessible to everyone.

Therefore I believe that a universal basic income or similar measures that re-distribute money from the winners of globalization to the losers, is the only realistic answer to the struggles of blue-collar workers.

Left-leaning partys around the world should adopt it as their answer to the populist,protectionist and often right-leaning movements that are trending currently.

**Why I want to be CMVed**
Sadly I believe not a lot of countries are ready to adopt UBI or will pursue it in the near future, therefore given my view that it is the only solution, my view is also very bleak.

**What will not convince me**
I will not be convinced by arguments portraying UBI as unrealistic (I concede as much for most countries in the near future) or detrimental (A point I am unwilling to believe).

**What will convince me**
Other ideas and solutions to the problem I stated or a realistic argument for as to why protectionism actually is a viable solution benefiting everyone (I am not a nativist, so any proposal helping one country at the expense of another get's a strong pass from me, even if the benefiting country is mine)

**Change my view!**

**Edit**
Just to stress it again, pointing out UBI doesn't work is not what is going to CMV, it's argumentation against the notion that there are no alternatives.
