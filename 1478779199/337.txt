OP isnt denying actions aren't taking place, he's denying that the effects of those outcomes weren't big enough to have any substantial effects on who the nominee was.  Did the DNC do stuff? Yes, but did it have a direct effect on the primaries, where Bernie never consistently had 50% of the popular vote overall?  But that's not rigging.  Was the election LITERALLY impossible to win?  Yes?   that is rigging.  OP is trying to see WHY that would have caused Bernie to lose?  Bernie lost every state with  larger minority voter populations and won the states with very high  very liberal white populations.  Was this due to the Clinton's early 30 year reign in increasing poverty in inner city areas?  Why was that due to rigging?  We saw emails pushing for bringing up religion or how far left his views were, but where was the substance?  Is there a direct connection where the DNC actually took that into play?  Or is it just conspiracy?
