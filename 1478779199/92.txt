Yes it's true that the politician you voted for is a racist in this scenario. But I would say, in this specific case, you are not racist yourself if your intention was to help non-whites by voting for the guy that increases their income by 10% instead of the other guy that increases it only by 8%. That his policies increase the income of white people by much more is just a side-effect.

Obviously this is very hypothetical but I liked the argument, that's why I awarded the delta.
