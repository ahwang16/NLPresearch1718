But, what if, while changing this, gerrymandering was significantly reduced? Do exactly what I'm talking about, but with logical boundaries.

Edit: but battleground districts would be easier to flip than an entire state, so pockets of blue in a sea of red all of a sudden become relevant, as opposed to completely meaningless now.
