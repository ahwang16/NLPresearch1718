>If the borg invaded space and assimilated everyone because the Federation wasn't rich enough to support an army to stop them would you still be arguing it was a bad idea to make colonies?

The Prime Directive calls for annihilation of a species as opposed to intervention, so I don't really think that this is a good justification. (TNG S2E15)  

If the only way to avoid the Borg overwhelming the Federation was to intervene on some sub-warp planet and direct production of X thing, they wouldn't do it.

Aside from the Omega Directive, the Prime Directive doesn't have many get out of jail free cards.  It's not about weighing the benefit versus the negatives, it's about a moral decision that intervention is wrong.

>They're against interfering with primitive species because it has bad results.

Not entirely necessary to the discussion, but I don't think that the quote necessarily supports that that is the only (or main) reason for the prime directive.  That could just be Picard's thoughts and that the Prime Directive has other reasons for existing: like just that we value the ability for species to develop on their own, not necessarily that it always has bad effects.  For instance, I could be a vegetarian because I think that eating meat is wrong, but it could also be the healthier choice and I could say "History has shown us that animal based diets are bad for your health" and that isn't the primary reason I'm a vegetarian.

Additionally, I think that quote was included as a jab at the US's policy of intervention during the cold war.
