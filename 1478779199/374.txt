I think that you are mixing apples and oranges a bit. A lot of people are unaware (but you seem to be) that the Prime Directive only applies to Starfleet personnel. Of course that means that Federation citizens who are not in Starfleet can do as they see fit.

But, you then make the case that "Starfleet" specifically is colonizing other planets. Is that the case? It seems like most colonies are started by private citizens, and are operating independently from Starfleet. Some may call on Starfleet for emergency aid, but many don't even do that.
