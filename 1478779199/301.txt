Splitting the state into districts might seem more fair, but it leaves the door open for horrible gerrymandering. As it is, the electoral districts in Maine and Nebraska are the same as the districts used to elect Representatives. These lines are often fought over, since drawing them in certain ways can lead to one party having an advantage. I believe the current consensus is that the district maps heavily favor Republicans.

Dividing people up into states is arbitrary, but at least state borders aren't redrawn every decade by politically motivated hacks. Getting rid of the electoral college is one thing, but allowing each district to decide its own electoral vote just makes gerrymandering even more powerful.
