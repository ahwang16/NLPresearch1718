Illegality does not define morality or justice. It just means somebody with a gun threatened you if you don't do what they say.

My point was that most labor laws tend to violate freedom of contract between employer and employee. Mexico is a much poorer country than the US. Poor Mexicans learn to live on less. If they and their employer agree on a wage, even if it is lower than I would take, why is it any of my, or anyone else's business? Its not.

Slavery, as we know, is a moral issue because it takes away a persons rights, usually of all them. And because it is illegal, it is also a legal issue.

The problem with kids working is its hard to tell when they can make rational, adult decisions for themselves. How can you tell if he really wants to take that shitty job?

Child labor is a touchy, gray subject, but I didn't mention either it or slavery in my last comment. Not sure why you brought it up and jumped to those conclusions. Where did I imply that an employee was not a willing participant in said contract? I didn't.

If my boss wanted to pay you twice as much as me to play on Reddit all day, I might think its a waste of money and resources, but I think you two should be allowed to agree to that, even if it is ridiculous. If you want to be paid half as much at my company, doing similar work, but  be compensated with food every day and a new car every 5 years, then so be it. I don't really care, because if you both agree to those terms, its nobody elses's business but yours. If you are being coerced against your will, then there is a problem and you want to bring government in.
