Again, use of the term illegals is obtuse in the least and something I personally take offense to. I'd encourage you to stop using it to describe a group of people.

I'm generally in support of the sanctions that currently exist, but the enforcement becomes the issue. This can most likely be assisted with increased resources devoted to enforcement.
