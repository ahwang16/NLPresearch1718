It very much is, which is why there is no good solution to the problem of illegal immigrants.  I don't necessarily know what the right answer is, but it's probably a combination of a number of different enforcement mechanisms.

My only point in all of this is that overly focusing on where they _work_ isn't going to get us very far.
