With all due respect, this response sounds a little like one with little faith in any form of government outreach at all.  Implementing a system, in my mind, of mandatory voting wouldn't just keep every other factor constant and just make it mandatory to vote, the system would also change to make it easier to vote.  Knowing what the will of the people is is a key factor of democracy, not what the will of 55% of the voting population is.
