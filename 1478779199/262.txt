There is nothing quick in terms of human lifespans about climate change. It is all occurring extremely slow from a perspective of a human life. It seems fast in reference to the history of the earth/universe, but in reality from a human perspective the changes are extremely slow. We will easily be able to adapt within time to any changes that occur from the warming of the earth. It isn't going to just change from one day to the next, the effects will be very obvious. People all around the world already are heavily invested in improving the situation and more and more people will as well as effects actually start happening around the world and not just from a long term data perspective. You vastly underestimate the adaptability and tenacity of the human species, we will survive.
