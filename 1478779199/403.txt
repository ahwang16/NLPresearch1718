I think you're discounting how many votes Trump gained out of dissatisfaction with Clinton and the DNC this election cycle. The problem with raw vote totals in a comparison like this is that Trump's success is due in part to a  reaction to who the opposing candidate was. He's not guaranteed those same vote totals against a different candidate.
