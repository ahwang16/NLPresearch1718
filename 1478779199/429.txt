Again not really what I want to discuss about but I am not sure I believe your line of argumentation.

Median income is a poor indicator for the kind of disenfranchisement I talk about. Certainly it's correlated to much with age. Young people overwhelmingly voted Democrat, naturally their reported income will be much lower.

Weighted for age, I suspect that the income disparity will diminish. Nonetheless I do not focus solely on the US election, it's the bigger picture. I do believe many in the Rust belt truly voted Trump because of their situation.

However this is even more true for people around the world. Voters of the AFD are overwhelmingly poor and unemployed relative to voters of other partys, as are voters of the Front National or the voters who gave us the Brexit.

Racism is fear mongering and those movements are successful with that because of the fear many people already have. Yes a lot of racist people voted Trump or AFD/FN because they are racist, however many more people voted for these ideologies not primarily because of pure racism.

That somebody who is well and truly disgusted by racism would be unable to vote for these movements is clear to me as well. However there is a large middle ground were people might not be 100% PC but this isn't what they vote on.
