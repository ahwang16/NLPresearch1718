Probably my last post for the next hours:
Many of you gave good reasons why you might want to vote for someone in spite of his discriminatory policies. However you are still supporting all of his policies (including the sexist/racist ones with your vote) if you give him your vote.
So in order to change my view you have to prove that my second premise in the OP is false.
