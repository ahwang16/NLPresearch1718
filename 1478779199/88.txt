The important part of the example that I gave was that the racist policies were part of a package such that the package as a whole was better for non-white people than the other one (10% gain in income for the racist package, vs. 8% gain in income for the non-racist package).

I'm not going to say that one should necessarily pick the racist package, there, but I think it's a valid and interesting question, that you can come down on either side of without being racist. Clearly the *best* outcome would be to pick aspects of both packages, and leave out the racism, but that isn't an option. It comes down to the question of "is it good to increase the income of non-whites by 2 percentage points while also increasing the income of whites by 15 percentage points?" Not an easy question.
