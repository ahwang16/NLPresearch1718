I probably can't convince _you_ that they are beneficial, because you disagree with the ideals themselves.  However, there are people who do think that each of these things a good idea.

- Enacting strict climate control legislation will limit our ability to be competitive in the global market place.
- The government shouldn't be in the business of funding research; that is what the private sector is for
- The NSA keeps us safe from domestic and foreign terrorist threats.
- He puts America's interests first.
- Being vulgar doesn't make you a bad POTUS.  LBJ used to shake his penis at people.

Again, you can disagree with any of those ideas, but that doesn't make you right; it just means that you have a different opinion.  

You have to _objectivly_ define terrible, otherwise we are just arguing politics.
