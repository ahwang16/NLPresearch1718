Under your system Hillary would have suffered an even greater electoral loss as most congressional districts are very lopsided to favor Republicans currently. Even if we don't assume ill intent and that these districts weren't drawn for the purpose of gerrymandering, then we're still left with the problem your trying to solve only now it's exacerbated. You've essentially taken all the problems of why you dislike the electoral college and magnified them by a factor of 10, by making hundreds more winner take all districts. 

Edit: A better solution would either be for states to assign their electors by strict proportionality (which I believe some of the states did early in US history) or by giving all of their electors to the winner of the popular vote (which several states are trying to do).
