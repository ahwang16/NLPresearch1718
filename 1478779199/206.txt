Seriously... they act like employers are accidentally hiring illegal workers without knowing it. I'm pretty sure most businesses hiring illegal immigrants known about it, since one of the benefits is being able to pay less than minimum wage. 

Also, I strongly suspect most are getting paid cash anyway... it seems foolish to leave a paper trail by having them on your actual payroll.
