I'm not going to argue whether these issues are or are not important.  That is not the scope of this discussion.

My one and only point was that you should not call them selfish or ignorant.  You should do what you just did - make an argument as to why that view is wrong and what elements of their assumptions are flawed.  The first step of that is realizing that these people have legitimate reasons for why the believe what they believe; the second step is showing them why those beliefs are flawed.

Arguments and open discussion change views.  Calling people names does not.
