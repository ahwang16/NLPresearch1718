A politician is not a policy they are a set of policies.  You have to take the good with the bad and weigh your options.  By your logic voting against Trump is also voting against everything he supports.

Lets say Trump is racist and homophobic and wants to stop the TPP.  You however are not racist or homophobic but you want to stop the TPP.  Now stopping the TPP is within the President's control but rolling back anti-discrimination legislation will require congress and the Supreme court.  So Trump can achieve the goals you support but will have trouble enacting the things you don't.  And if you vote against Trump that would mean your supporting the TPP.
