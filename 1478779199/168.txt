> Selfish and ignorant are exactly the words to describe people who support those policies.

There is a _legitimate_ argument to be made about focusing on economic issues over environmental ones.  There is also a legitimate argument to using all of our resources to protect the citizens from foreign and domestic terrorism.  You (and I FWIW) believe that argument to be wrong, but that doesn't mean the other side doesn't have merit. 

You should endeavor to change people's minds, not call them stupid.  Calling them selfish and ignorant will not make them more likely to support your way of thinking; rather, it will make them more likely to retreat into an echo chamber where their views are not challenged.  Calling them selfish and ignorant is _exactly_ why the came out enmass to support Donald Trump.
