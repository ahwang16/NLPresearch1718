its no longer interference if they predate sentient species, its then called cohabitation, they are then the natural predator/prey of the planet,   evolution or spaceship doesn't matter when it comes to the time it takes for sentient life to develop.

the prime directive is for where there is already sentient life for then we would be invasive species.
