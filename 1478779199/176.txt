CMV: IF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARE TAKING AMERICAN JOBS, AND THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM, WE SHOULD BE GOING AFTER THE ENTITIES EMPLOYING THE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.

I totally don't believe illegal immigration is the problem at all. And I certainly despise the use of the word "illegals" to describe the PEOPLE that are doing what they can to improve their life. 

But I don't think we'll find too many people willing to be undocumented workers if they are then forced to spend their non working time locked in a basement. That sounds more like human trafficking and is a much different issue to combat.
