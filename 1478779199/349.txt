Voter suppression laws are enacted to keep US citizens from voting in US elections.  If you want to draw an applicable comparison to the DNC only letting Democrats vote in their primary, it would be that the US has rules that don't allow non-citizens to vote.

The idea that the party should be able to take steps to prevent non members from deciding who their candidate will be is at a minimum not one you can dismiss out of hand.  I think the specifics can certainly be debated, but claiming any attempt by the DNC to make sure only or mostly Democrats voted in the primary is rigging seems very silly.

Further, if you truly want to talk about voter suppression, it's hard to find something more suppressing than caucuses, which Sanders did overwhelmingly better in.  Ironically the biggest "rigging by voter suppression" of the DNC primary benefited Sanders.

As for the religion email, you still haven't demonstrated how this actually lead to any action.  Someone else gave an example of action on this front, and I don't see how it can even begin to be considered "rigging."  You can find that conversation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5c8cfv/cmv_i_dont_think_the_dnc_rigged_the_election/d9uym41/) if you like.

Your final point does not have anything to do with rigging the election.  At most it is an article stating that the DNC should have gone against the will of their voters and selected Bernie as their candidate.  While that is certainly arguable, it also doesn't in any way contradict the point I was making, which was that *since* Hillary was clearly the choice the Democrats at that point in the primary, and the DNC was going to follow the will of the voters, *then* the DNC should maybe have pushed Sanders out far harder than they did in order to focus on the general.
