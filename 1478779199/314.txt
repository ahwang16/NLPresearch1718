> But that means a 51-49 split is just as good as a 60-40. The additional votes are meaningless.

And the same is true in your system too, it just depends on what side of the imaginary line they fall on.

Also, why is the "meaningfulness" of the vote so important to you? I don't think it's just for anyone's vote to be more meaningful than someone else's but it seems like what you really want is for elections to be decided by a minority of voters who live in certain niche districts.

I mean in your system you could have a candidate get 30.03% or 79.98% of the votes and still receive the same 3 electors.
