>  I completely agree with you, I just think it's a lot harder to tell corporations what to do versus telling immigrants what to do.

I don't understand this reasoning. The corporation has a listed address, and documents for every decision, and everyone involved in the decision. Small businesses as well, have to itemize their spending for everything. You can look at those documents and see cash flow out to an empty space, and find out if something shady is going on. These would be one of the vectors for the government penalizing businesses that use undocumented immigrants.

On the other hand, immigrants that fly here on visas and overstay them, or hop a border, however they do it - they're individuals or small groups from all over the world. There isn't a network or business of shipping people to the U.S. to work, and the small coyote outfits that do it don't use paperwork, nor do they operate on U.S. soil. So the wall, and border patrols, and increased security and crackdowns aren't 'sending a message' to everyone outside the border who may want to come in. 

All of this then leads down to; something different, or more needs to be done about the immigration process itself. If people only have a problem with people here illegally, and there are so many struggles to immigrate here legally, then the process of how people get their citizenship needs to be modified to de-incentivize people from trying their luck breaking the law.
