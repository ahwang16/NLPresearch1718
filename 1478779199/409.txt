You can fight it, but you are fighting against what is considered the majority.  To take it to an unlikely extreme, if majority of people in the US wanted completely close borders to every country, and not just Mexico and Islamic countries, they would elect a congressman/woman who would promise to fight for closed borders, since there is no infringement on constitutional freedom.  

Just as people who didn't agree with LBGT rights (let's generalize and say the rural republicans) can resist its acceptance, enough people have spoken for it, so it is something the right-wingers have to accept.

You must accept what most voter's want in this country.
