This is exactly why it's better to improve paths to citizenship. The reason why illegals work for so little money is because they don't have the legal protections of a citizen. Employers are free to exploit them. And that exploitation comes in many forms. It could be 12 hour days performing hard labor for minuscule wages. Or it could be the threat of retaliation by the company or other immigrant families if they report their company for stuff like safety violations.
