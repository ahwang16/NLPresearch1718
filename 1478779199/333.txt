I'm confused, why would an election held by a private party to determine that private party's candidate be required to be *more* fair than an election held by the government to elect the president?

Further, as I said in my op there are arguments for making it more difficult for someone who hasn't consistently supported the Democrats by registering as one to vote in a primary that determines who represents the party. You can disagree with them, but you can not dismiss them out of hand and certainly can't call it rigging the system.

Beyond the rules which you may or may not agree with but are clearly not rigging, you and many people say that the party took steps to favor Hillary. What were they? I've had one person tell me to read the emails and someone else linked an article that laid out complaints and linked the email.....and it didn't even begin to show rigging.
