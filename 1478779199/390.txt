>  I'm looking to see if anyone can prove those assumptions are faulty enough to make my view be wrong. 

But that's not what you wrote in the title and not how CMV works. Your claim was that Trump would have won but it's all based on assumptions for which you haven't shown any proof. It's not necessary that others proof you wrong, it sufficient to show that you aren't right. Based on what you provided we can't know. So your view should change from "Trump would have won" to "we can't know unless we find more data". 

It's the same argument as with religion. Religious people don't have any proof for God, so they can't claim that a God exists, you don't have to proof that there isn't a God to show that you can't know as there isn't any evidence.
