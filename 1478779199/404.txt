In a democratic society, elected officials are voted into office by people who vote.  While the electoral collage is imperfect, Trump received enough votes to secure a victory, which suggests that many voter's views align with Trump's.  

Protesting against Trump is essentially protesting against your neighbors, (most) of which favor his views.  Part of living in a society in which majority rules involves accepting policies that an individual or group may not agree with, but a great majority of people do.
