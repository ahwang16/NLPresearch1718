To quote a very influential former US president: "It's the economy stupid"

While the media focused a lot on personal properties, a very large portion of the population votes on economic policy, and a huge percentage of the population in the states that swung this election (Wisconsin / Michigan), are disillusioned with the idea of free trade and open economic borders, and voted accordingly (this was also seen in the primary elections where Bernie Sanders who trumpeted the protectionist left position destroyed Clinton's globalist left position in said primaries), so for at least a significant portion of the population in the states that arguably swung the election the deciding factor was likely protectionism vs globalism, or to put it simply "the economy stupid".
