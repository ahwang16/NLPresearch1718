You are trying to argue that the DNC did this to themselves because they are corrupt. If the RNC were just as corrupt, they would not have "done it to themselves" unless it were leaked by a hacker. You joke about lizards and ISIS, but Trump was the one claiming the same type of "rigging" by the RNC during the primaries. Trump himself stinks of corruption with the Trump Foundation bribing an attorney general to not investigate the scam of Trump University. We never got to see the private emails behind that.
