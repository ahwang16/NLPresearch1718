Unless you show me examples of those charges of sexism, I can't really refute or accept them. I'm not trying to be mean or stubborn, but I genuinely do not know of those legitimate claims.

>I'm not saying he grabbed a woman by the pussy. I'm saying he bragged about grabbing women by the pussy. That act is misogynistic.

We clearly have different definitions of misogyny which I don't think will be resolved through an online debate. I don't think Trump had any intent to cause harm, resentment, or division of or towards women with his actions or words, and that is the threshold I personally have for racism, sexism, etc.
