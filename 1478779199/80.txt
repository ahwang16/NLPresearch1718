I think it's possible to support someone who is racist *despite* the fact that they are racist. This would mean you are still taking actions that have the effect of supporting racism, but that might be a thing that is painful to you, but worth it for some other reason.

For example, let's imagine a scenario in which we have *way* better information about the future than we do now. Looking only at income growth, Candidate A will increase everyone's income by 8% over 4 years. Candidate B will increase the income of white americans by 25%, and non-white americans by 10%, because they have racist policies but also better fiscal policies overall. In that case do you think that voting for Candidate B would necessarily make you racist?

That is clearly a contrived example, and there's no way we could have that knowledge about the future, but it shows how different things might play off each other in a way that leads someone who is not personally racist to vote for someone who has racist policies.
