Except this argument doesn't hold up well. There will *always* be people who are negatively affected by social and economic policies. Some of these people are going to be white people. For example, I'm a black person with a poor background. The ACA has negatively affected my family's ability to provide for our health and general well-being(insane payment rates). Does this mean that the whites who support the ACA and indirectly end up hurting my demographic are all racists?

To get to my point, if we can establish that *white* people can also be negatively impacted by the the policies others of their race support, than the whole 'you are racist and that is despicable viewpoint' doesn't hold as much as water because then we would be a debate about an arbitrary amount of white people 'count' before it's not racism.
