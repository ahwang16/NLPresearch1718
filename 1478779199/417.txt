CMV: ELECTIONS AREN'T AUTOMATICALLY A BROAD, SWEEPING MANDATES FOR A PARTICULAR SIDE. CATACLYSMIC STATEMENTS ARE UNHELPFUL.

Many conservatives were making statements before the election to the effect of this:

> Hillary Clinton is being elected based on Trump's problems, not because of her strengths. She will have to govern from the middle, listen to both sides, and respect the check of Congress.

Now, I see liberals falling over themselves, expecting the end of the goddamn world. If we expect an election this close (decided by the total population of Peoria, illinois) to be a complete, 100% mandate for him - that reasoning still has the same flaws. It seems pretty clear to me that he was the choice as a **rejection of Clinton and the establishment**, not because his ideas or policies were universally approved. It also seems like many of his swing supporters don't take his policies seriously.

I get that US Foreign Policy lives in the executive. That makes sense. However, I'm not clear why everyone is now saying "Obamacare is dead. Gay rights are dead. Civil rights are dead."

If you, because of this incredibly narrow election, expect society to make fundamental changes, you weaken your ability to resist those changes. Trump needs Congress to agree to his policies, and he needs those policies to go unchecked by the Supreme Court.

For example, Murkowski, McCain, Toomey, Rubio, Paul, and Portman are all US Senators reelected **this year** who have supported LGBT rights, for example. If we assume that Donald Trump has absolute power, we weaken our ability to work together to defeat policy ideas that are truly unpopular with Americans.

I get that people are scared. That's ok. What disturbs me is how many seem to be saying "it's over."
