First, a little balm for your wounds.

Less than 1/5 of the population voted for Trump. The vast majority never went to the polls. I don't know their reasons, but some of them were eligible and registered. Some never got registered. Some lost their right to vote because in jail or on probation when the election happened... a lot actually.

As for those who voted Trump... there are voters who view elections more strategically than merely considering whether the candidate is suited to office. Those votes don't support sexism or racism. But they defer the significance of those issues to other things.

Conservatives wanted conservatives appointing Supreme Court Judges for the next 4 years. There are two liberal judges with a lot of miles on them that might expire before another election cycle. From a coldly strategic viewpoint regarding the ability to steer the Supreme Court on issues like gun control, privacy rights, and other issues, a Trump vote doesn't support sexism.

There are also those who view Trump as a weapon they hope will disrupt and destabilize things. The entire point of voting for him, in some peoples eyes, is that he will prove once and for all how dysfunctional our system of government is right now. Or to demonstrate to the Democrats that manipulating the nomination for a centrist candidate when the voting base doesn't want her is a bad strategy.
