Well, I'm happy to know that, and I'm certainly gonna visit this sub more often, if that's the case.

It just baffles me that SO many people all across the Internet spend SO much time focusing their attention and devoting their free time to things that they don't like and outrages them. I mean, do so many people have nothing else to do, or shitty enough lives that this is their only outlet for rage?
