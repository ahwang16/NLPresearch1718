Trump will appoint Scalia's replacement when he takes office.  If Justice Ginsberg, Kennedy, or Breyer retires or passes away, Trump will be able to appoint one more Supreme Court Justice.  Marriage equality was only decided by a 5-4 vote.  One more Republican Justice could flip that to 5-4 in the other direction.  Cases like *Hobby Lobby* have already helped to expand religious freedom rights to allow for discrimination against LGBT individuals in many states, and this will expand with a more conservative Supreme Court.
