Correct. But two things here:

1) Some people are so extreme in their thinking that they, yes, they think the Clintons have had people killed. So this fact alone, if it were true, would make it reasonable to choose Trump over Clinton. That being said!...

2) While Clinton is not a murderer, she is deplorable enough to be considered worse than Trump. Well, according to many of the people who voted for him. Remember, to them, Trump was the lesser of two evils, despite the fact that he said xenophobic things. So this wouldn't make them xenophobic themselves, it's just that their hands were tied behind their backs; they felt they had no choice.
