I've seen a lot of this kind of talk, and I can understand why people would think that. The thing you have to understand is that politics isn't binary. Yes, Trump has said some racist and sexist things, but does that invalidate any of his policies? Does that impact on his ability to lead? Does that mean he doesn't hold other, more valid views? I can see how that might impact on international relations, but I genuinely believe he will tone it all down when he takes office. He isn't an idiot, I doubt he would patronise other heads of state, male or female. 


So I guess in essence my point is that people are viewing this very one dimensionally. For sure, there was a portion of Trump voters who are sexist and racist, and that is why they support him, but there is a large portion of people who voted for him because they like his other views, his America first message, or they are sick of politicians, sick of not being listened to, sick of a lot of things. Calling all of those people sexists and racists is wrong! People can vote for Trump because they think his economic policy (just an example) will be good for America, knowing that anything he does that will negatively impact people based on gender and race won't get passed. Arguably, I think its just as bad that people were voting for Hillary just because shes a woman, as people voting for Trump because he is sexist.
