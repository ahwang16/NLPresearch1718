I didn't go into this too much in my op but here it goes.

So first question, do you think that the USA cares about a person's religion?

Second question, do you think it is correct for a political party to not find out what their candidate's beliefs are?

Now I hadn't seen that town hall meeting and just watched it, and that is the most softball version of that question I could think of. They gave him so much leeway to make a grandiose speech (which he did quite well imo) and did nothing else to try and play "gotcha" with further questions "but are you a Christian or Jew?"

Which leads to my third question. Do you honestly view that question as evidence of the DNC rigging the election against Sanders?
