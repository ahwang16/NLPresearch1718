This is the point everyone is missing when they say "but we are a nation of immigrants."  When Europeans arrived on these shores they were not immigrating to the U.S.  There was no U.S.  The land was inhabited by various tribes of native Americans.  I'm not justifying what happened to them but the reality is that this is an established country now in the modern sense.  There was no U.N.  Native-born citizens have a say in the U.S just like every other country.  Anyone has a right to immigrate here but go through the proper channels and respect those who work hard and save to come here.
