> Wikileaks didn't create that evidence, they just revealed them to the public.

The revealed it to the public in such a way to harm the Clinton campaign. Assange clearly stated his intentions. If they were interested in transparency, they would have dumped it all as soon as it was ready.

> It's not hackers' fault, it's DNC's fault, hackers would not be needed if everything was fair.

The hackers made it unfair. We got private information for one side, but not the other. The RNC could be just as corrupt and unfair, but we'd never know.
