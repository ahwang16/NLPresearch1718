> The United States is founded on the principle or liberty, or having the choice to do whatever you want as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others. 

That's simply not true. The United States was founded on the principle that we consent to a government having the power to defend our liberty, which inherently involves taking away some of our liberty for the purpose of preserving others. We did not start nor have we ever been a libertarian utopia.
