But the premise is contradictory. There is no situation where racist policies (again, a term he used to describe the situation) somehow have a net positive effect on PoC. By nature of the very premise, these policies will adversely affect PoC on the grounds that they are inferior for their skin color. Continuing on, yes. Voting for that is racist because you are accepting the racist premise the idea is built on. 

Sure in an ideal world we'd pick and choose. But that's not the world we live in.
