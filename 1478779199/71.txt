I voted for Hillary even though I genuinely believe she is corrupt and deluded by the Washington bubble. I don't think that makes me deluded or corrupt. I can acknowledge that some Trump voters have priority issues that may cause them to ignore the bigotry. If you think trade, abortion, or immigration will do more harm then bigotry, then you could very well vote for Trump. Even if that line of reasoning is flawed, it is still a line of reasoning that isn't motivated by bigotry.
