CMV: EVERY STATE SHOULD GO BY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS LIKE MAINE & NEBRASKA

Some districts would be easier to shift. Many would be just as lopsided. There's a reason that we have such a ridiculously high incumbency rate for Congressmen to the point where in several locations they run uncontested, and that's a large majority of our congressional districts simply aren't competitive.

>  So local GOTV efforts will be much stronger

If you happen to live in a swing district, if you're in a safe district then you'll be in the same position as before. So this would really lead to more or less that same GOTV efforts just more concentrated on specific areas. Also, personally this is part of the electoral process that I really despise. The election should come down to which candidate the majority of people prefer, not which campaign has the better organization (aka money) to get people to vote in strategic areas.

A better solution would either be for states to assign their electors by strict proportionality (which I believe some of the states did early in US history) or by giving all of their electors to the winner of the popular vote (which several states are trying to do).
