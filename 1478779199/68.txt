I know what you are trying to say but you can't really compare TPP to a cultural issue like discrimination:

If I stay silent when somebody says something racist or sexist and do not speak out against it, I am quietly confirming his view. The "It was just a joke" - sentiment keeps racism and misogyny strong.

"So yeah, it's just a shirt. And it's just an ad. It's just a saying. It's just a TV show. It's just the Internet. Yes, but you almost make as much as a man does. It's just a catcall. It's a compliment! It's just that boys will be boys. It's just that she's a slut. It's just that your dress is too short. It's just that we want to know what you were wearing at the time, ma'am. It's just it's just it's just. It's just a death by a thousand cuts. No one cut does the deed. In the end, they all do."
â€”Phil Plait


But not speaking out against TPP does not automatically make you support it.
