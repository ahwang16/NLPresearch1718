I disagree that UBI doesn't supply dignity, on the contrary it frees you up to pursue what you really want to, regardless of economic factors.

However this CMV isn't about UBI, it's about the question whether there is something else to offer to people that feel lost in an ever globalizing economy as a reasonable alternative.

As I said, pointing out UBI doesn't work is not what is going to CMV, it's argumenting against the notion that there are no alternatives.
