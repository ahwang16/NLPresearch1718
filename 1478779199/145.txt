Those laws exist because some people are at a disadvantage due to their race, gender, etc.

If one baseball team is playing without gloves, and the other has all the equipment they need, it doesn't "negatively affect" the well-equipped team to give the other team the gloves they need, unless you believe they *should* have an unfair advantage.
