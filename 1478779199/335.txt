> Beyond the rules which you may or may not agree with but are clearly not rigging, you and many people say that the party took steps to favor Hillary. What were they?

To elaborate slightly, do you agree there need to be rules?  Further, do you agree that it is understandable, regardless of whether you agree with the extent, that the DNC would enact rules that make it more likely that the candidate chosen to represent the DNC is voted for by people who are actually members of the DNC?
