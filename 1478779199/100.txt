If you want gays to be able to marry but vote for someone who wants to cut down on lgbt-rights just because you prioritize his policies on economy than you still support homophobia.
I guess you are challenging my second premise, saying that if you support homophobia, you don't necessarily have to be a homophobe yourself.

I'm not entirely convinced but close to giving you a delta :)
