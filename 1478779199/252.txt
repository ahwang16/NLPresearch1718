We need the ecosystems of this planet to survive. I don't see a way around that in the foreseeable future. (And we can dispense with a semantic debate about what that means). 

If conditions on Earth become like they were in the Permian-Triassic event I do not think humanity would survive. 

> That being said, I don't think the Earth will ever get that bad. As it stands, even with what may seem to be advances that are "too slow" to many people, humans civilization is actually quite concerned about the environment, and have taken enormous steps in the past 20 years in terms of advancing technologies that would enable a sustainable society. 

The steps we have taken to mitigate the damage we are doing pales in comparison to the steps we have taken to increase our ability to do harm. In 2015 China constructed four coal-fired power plants per week. 

And I strongly disagree that "human civilization is actually quite concerned about the environment." I'm sure *you* are concerned, as am I, but no, human civilization as a whole is not. There is not even a consensus that the problem exists, much less that solving it should be our top priority.

The point here is that our ability to destroy inevitably grows faster than our ability to repair. It isn't that humans cannot progress to the point where we can solve our current problems, but that by the time we reach that point we will have also expanded the scope and severity of the problems.
