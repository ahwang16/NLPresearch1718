This was a comment that I previously wrote for somebody else but I think it applies to your views well: 

Are you really arguing that in a scenario between a racist presidential candidate and say a candidate that believes that there should be a culling of the population to reduce the population by 60%. In said scenario, voting for the racist, makes you a racist? Seriously nothing else matters? Now obviously Clinton isn't that bad but I'm using hyperbole to show that one view on one issue does not decide who to vote for. If you believe that combating racism is the most important thing this country needs, than you might vote against a racist. But somebody who IS against racism may believe that having a job or focusing on environmental issues are more important to them and may compromise their own beliefs because after all no candidates beliefs will perfectly align with yours. Candidates are not one dimensional and should not be treated that way.
