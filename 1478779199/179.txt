> Compare this to going after the source of the labor.  We _know_ where they are getting in - it's a few  thousand miles of border between the US and Mexico.  That is _much_ easier to allocate resources to such a small area where _everyone_ that is coming across can either be screened in one place or is crossing illegally.  

Not OP, but I'd like to dig into this for a bit. FWIW, I'm from Texas, and have visited large swaths of the border fence from Texas to California. It's pretty hard to miss, and 2000 miles of border is fucking huge.

What percentage of illegal immigrants are actually illegally crossing the border each year. My understanding, though it could be flawed, is that a majority of new illegal immigrants to the US aren't using the border anymore. I was under the impression that visa overstays from countries in Asia are contributing much more to our illegal immigration problem than Mexico or South America. Compounding that, illegal immigrants from the south are also using visas to get in, rather than crossing the border.

So, in essence, and I'm hoping you can help me find some numbers here:

Roughly how many illegal immigrants are entering the Us each year?

What percentage of those are crossing the border?

How do these numbers line up historically? Are either one increasing or decreasing over the past decade.
