I admit, it's hard to disagree with any of this. âˆ†

But I do feel that this mindset is sad. We're essentially admitting that a problem is too much to handle and we'd rather work against one of the key ideals of the nation....we are a nation of immigrants. 

>Sometimes the solution to the root problem is too difficult to solve so we have to go for a less effective, but actionable, solution.

I think this is the line that disappoints me most in the issue.
