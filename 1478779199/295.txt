This election has brought upon a lot of people scared of what will happen to them in near future. And they have every right to do so since gay marriage just became a thing less than a year ago. What I don't believe is the idea that Trump will leave leagues of stripped rights from the LGBT community or the idea that Pence will get conversion therapy in acion as he so declaratively believes. I personally don't identify with any party and I'm conflicted on the manner, but I never thought I'd say this, I'm with Trump.
