That doesn't show graciousness. It shows a realistic interpretation of things. There are two schools of thought here and both are equally valid. 

1) You should show the picture as soon as you possibly can because it is fair to your friend

or 

2) You should hold onto it for the last moment and hope that your friend has the good sense to notice it her/himself first- but at the same time be ready just in case he/she is about to make a horrible mistake.

While I personally would rather knowing right away, that is because I honestly am really bad at finding out this sort of stuff myself. I know other people who would rather know that their friend has the trust and faith in them to give them a chance before jumping to it. Both are valid, both are fine.
