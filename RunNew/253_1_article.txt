By a margin of 2 to 1, respondents say America should take action to reduce our fossil fuel use.

Only one third of respondents agree with the Republican Party’s position on climate change, while about half agree with the party’s position on how to meet America’s energy needs.

A large majority of respondents say their elected representatives are unresponsive to their views about climate change. Download as PDF Download the Report Download Full Report PDF Document Project Climate Change in the American Mind
