There is no coherent theory of election analysis based on class differences or wealth. 

[In the primaries](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mythology-of-trumps-working-class-support/?ex_cid=story-twitter), #1#Trump's supporters had a household income above the national median, while Sanders was on par with Clinton, both being slightly below it.#1#  In the general election, he got less votes than Mitt Romney. Even ignoring the actual wealth positions, not an uprising of disenfranchised people, that't the opposition shitting the bed this particular time. 

Complaints about others "taking our jobs", are directly clashing with 5% and dropping unemployment rates both in Britain and in the US. 

These are people who **already have jobs**, voting for a candidate who is promising only to take away the below-minimum-wage sweathsops from China.

It's tempting to call them poor ignorant masses who have ben duped and don't realize that what they actually need is minimum wage hikes and maybe eventually UBI. 

But *how educated do you have to be*, not to notce that you already have a minimum wage job, and the agenda you are backing is only promising you even more factory jobs? 

At that level of incoherence, combined with the data about voter wealth levels, one must conclude that the economical side of the noise is a dogwhistle for cultural discontentment with the world, rather than a meaningful set of financial grievances.
