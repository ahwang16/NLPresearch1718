As you can see, the punishments are pretty steep, including heavy fines, and forfeiture of assets including entire buildings.

The main problem with concentrating efforts on the employers is that they have to "knowingly" hire them as illegals, which is hard to prove unless the employer is doing a large campaign to do so (as in the examples in the link). If you have a couple illegals out of 150 employees, it's pretty easy for a lawyer to just say they did their due diligence, but a few just "fell between the cracks."

In addition, there aren't many people who are incentivized to report. The immigrant isn't going to report himself, and the employer sure as hell isn't either. A legal employee at the same company might do so, but it'll be his job on the line as well. It's just easier for that guy to tell the authorities about a one or two illegals at his company, than to take out the entire company, and lose his own job in the process.
