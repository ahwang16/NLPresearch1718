I'm going to premise this by saying that I think Bernie is a generally good person, but I think people are wearing rose tinted glasses in evaluating if he would have won the general if he had been the democratic nom. Below, I lay out 3 arguments why I don't think he would have won/outperformed Clinton.

**Hillary went easy on Bernie in the primaries, and he would have had more scandals in the general**

There's a ton of information about Bernie that Hillary didn't bring up because it wouldn't be useful in front of a democratic audience. However, in the general, these things could be devastating. Namely, his #1#[honeymoon in the USSR,]#1# (http://origin-www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-02-11/how-bernie-sanders-spent-his-soviet-honeymoon) his essay about #2#[rape fantasies,]#2# (http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/05/29/410606045/the-bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy-essay-explained) and the fact that he's a #3#[career politician who's worked for government for 40 years]#3# (http://www.inquisitr.com/3371682/bernie-sanders-is-a-career-politician-not-a-revolutionary). He would be very easy to paint as a socialist, which is still in a boogeyman among the white working class/rural voters that he could theoretically pull that Clinton couldn't. It would also be a harder challenge to pull Republican women because both of those things listed above.


**He wouldn't have inspired black/hispanic turnout.**

#4#The primary reason Clinton won overwhelmingly in the primary is because of [black and hispanic turnout]#4#(http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/2016-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democrats-race-racial-divide-213948). She's built inroads with those communities for decades. 

However, in the general, #5#she [failed to energize]#5# (http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/08/politics/first-exit-polls-2016/) those 2 groups sufficiently to win. If she failed to capture that core Democratic group, than there's no reason Sanders would have sufficiently closed that gap to overwhelm the turnout that Trump would inspire among rural americans.

**He would not be able to capture Trump voters because he doesn't tap into racial anxiety, and actually causes religious anxiety**

Bernie sanders doesn't scape goat minorities, LGBT, or refugees.Unfortunately #6#[this is what many trump voters wanted to see]#6# (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/06/racial-anxiety-is-a-huge-driver-of-support-for-donald-trump-two-new-studies-find/). As a result, he probably would not have peeled off enough cultural Trump voters to overcome Trump's lead.

#7#He also faces the challenge of being Jewish, which I believe would probably alienate him from a few points of the Black and Hispanic vote, [which tend to be relatively religious]#7# (https://news.virginia.edu/content/sociologist-faith-family-friendly-force-african-americans-and-latinos). It's unfortunate, but true that I think he would've faced discrimination for this from muslim and christian democrats.


Based on these factors, I don't see him flipping any states that Clinton failed to win, and as a result, probably doing equally as badly or worse than her.
