So clearly, we are living in a time where we feel justified to hate on "illegals". The solution that the president-elect has been talking about for years is a giant wall on the US southern border. I see this solution as such:

I have a giant block of cheese sitting in the middle of my house. Mice will not stop getting into my house and eating this block of cheese (I don't think mice are really into cheese like this, but I can't think of a better analogy at the moment). So my idea is to leave the block of cheese and try catching the mice and releasing them back outside my house. Of course, they know the cheese is there and they keep coming for the cheese. 

The problem with undocumented workers coming into the country to take jobs is that there is someone offering these jobs to undocumented workers. Construction crews, agriculture, etc., are all industries where the leaders can save a whole lot of money by having undocumented workers, pay them salaries below minimum wage, offer no benefits, and threaten to have them deported. 

What I think we should do is go after these people. If instead of a giant wall and an insane increase in a task force, it would be a lot cheaper to have a regulative authority that regularly audits and investigates companies that engage in this practice. And companies that are found engaging in it should face severe punishment....I'm talking massive fines for first offense and revoking of business licenses in other offenses, potentially increasing to the point of confiscating the business and property. 

I assume that there is already a bit of a penalty in place for these employers, but the risk of getting caught must still be cheaper than the cost of only hiring American workers at decent wages. 

EDIT: Okay everyone, I object to using the word illegal to describe an entire group of people. #1#It's insensitive, offensive, and in the context, racist.#1# http://ideas.time.com/2012/09/21/immigration-debate-the-problem-with-the-word-illegal/

EDIT 2: Let me clarify my personal views. I think this country needs MORE immigration, not less. I think we need open borders and that we're moving towards globalization and overall, we need to move away from the idea of American superiority. I truly don't believe that illegal immigration is a problem severe enough to warrant building a massive wall, though I do concede that it may be easier to try to keep people out than to try to regulate business. My main issue is the republican talking point, and one of the cornerstones of the president-elect's campaign that blames undocumented workers for taking American jobs and making the country less safe. And I do believe that even though it's not an easy thing to do, we should be working more to fight the people that wish to exploit desperate people than the people willing to do anything to improve the lives of their family.
