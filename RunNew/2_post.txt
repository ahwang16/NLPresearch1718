Does that matter though? Comey sent one letter that didn't contain any information, and that dominated the headlines for a week, even as he later sent another letter basically saying "nvm". Go to Breitbart.com, peruse it a bit, and then think about what they could creatively come up with to discredit Sanders, especially since it doesn't have to be true. Quibbling over 'socialism' vs. 'democratic socialism' is completely missing the point.

You also mention the debates: after each debate, Clinton had a substantial polling boost, but a few weeks later, all of that was in the back of the mind, gone. A strong showing in the debates would not have helped Sanders any more than it has helped Clinton.

Turnout might have been different, yes, that could have done it. But would it have been enough? Who knows. Additionally, Sanders might have sent more corporate interests, and hence more money, towards Trump. In conservative circles there were a lot of 'Never Trumpers' (obviously not enough to prevent a Trump victory), but with the prospect of Sanders as president many of those dinosaurs could have thrown in their lot with him anyway. It could have further boosted traditional republican turnout (I don't know, someone should look through the exit poll data). Hillary outspent Trump significantly - what would Trump have done with an enormous war chest?
