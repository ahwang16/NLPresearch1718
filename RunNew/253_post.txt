Actually, human civilization is becoming increasingly concerned with global warming at a surprising rate. According to [this article](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/republican-views-on-climate-change/), #1#more than half of surveyed Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe climate change is real and would take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions#1#. I looked at a lot of similar articles/studies, and the numbers range from slightly less than 50% to over 70%. Even the biggest skeptics of global warming are changing their tune.
