Premise 1: Trump has certainly said racist, sexist things, but his actions don't really suggest he is worse than the average person. I think we are all guilty of making tasteless jokes from time to time, but that doesn't mean we are racists. Trump does not have the filter that polished politicians do, so he comes off as brash and mean.

Premise 2 & 3: If you accept my first premise, then they are not voting for a bigot.

Either way, Robert Byrd was a US senator and former head of the KKK and #1#"Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton once heaped praise for late Klan leader Sen. Robert Byrd."#1# (http://www.snopes.com/clinton-byrd-photo-klan/), so by your premises, she is also a racist/bigot and thus so are her supporters.
