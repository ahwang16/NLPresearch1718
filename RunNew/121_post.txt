So what you're saying is 'reading fiction is pointless'. No it isn't. 

This isn't a case of trying to teach you about the value of reading.

 What I'm going to say is this: 'Just because you don't *get it* doesn't mean it isn't a thing.'

This isn't something insignificant like using an emoji at the end of a text. #1#It's WRITTEN FICTION something that has been developed constantly since the beginning of writing some [8000 years ago] #1#(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing).

So you don't like books. That's fine, but nobody is any under obligation to convince you of it's worth. But since this is CMV I'll link [this page](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=jk+rowling+net+worth&rlz=1C1CHFX_enAU675AU675&oq=jk+r&aqs=chrome.2.0j69i57j0l4.3471j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). #2#1 billion is pretty good for someone who wrote something that has no value.#2#

I'd also like to point out that if this really is your opinion it makes you look immature as fuck.

But hey, you don't read.
