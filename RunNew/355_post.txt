Note: I might have different feelings about Mr. Trump regarding other issues, but I try not to use ad hominem and neither should anyone commenting.

The basis for Mr. Trumps argument is that globalism is bad for the US economy, and therefor for US workers, since he belives in trickle down economy.

The main issue with this proposal is that #1#[the US is importing goods with a value of 700 billion USD more than it is exporting]#1#(https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0004.html) this means, that every tax imposted by the US will have more griveous implications for the US market, since 

1. the price hike will be directly offset by price increase to the customer
2. any tax will be matched with a "countertax" matching the US' tax and therfor increasing viability of foreign made high tech goods (European products)

I dont think any smallish tax will bring jobs back where the margin for the retailer in the US is above 1.5 ish to double the imposed tax right now, which is likely a lot. The  costs to get production started in markeds that are already settled is too much of a risk, given the possibility of a total revision of this plan in 4 years. No one is investing millions into production facilities without the prospect of a secure investment for a long time and a fast return on their money. Which is nothing that can be guaranteed given that exporting said products will be equally complicated because of the "countertax".

While I see that the US- market is vast, I dont see the possibility for more a self- sufficient marked given the circumstances of dependence on chinese raw products for *all* high tech products (Speaking with personal experience, working for a global player in chemistry) 

overall I assume that the market will react badly to price hikes for the consumer in driving the devide between those who can affort it and those who cannot even further instead of making it smaller.

I can see the US market react badly to both tax on their products (by other nations) and to US imposed tax on foreign products on which the consumer and the economy depend on while being competitive. 

This will lead to factories who operate on smallish margins ( car manufacturing suppliers ) going out of buisness if they are dependent on any foreign made product or raw materials. Which will lead to a greater dependence on foreign made products by default, the exact opposite of the intended result.


Obviously there are ways to impose selective tax on foreign products, but this does not ensure that foreign countries will limit their tax as well. If one party is starting a trade war, I would assume other parties will not just watch while their economy hurts.

Change my view.
