Right. However, I think the more important take away is that the personal imperative to vote for a person is going to be different for every person.  As a very strict and arbitrary example: 

If you think Gays not being able to get married is a 10/10 on your personal "Oh shit" meter, you are going to prioritize that thusly when you select your candidate.

If I on the other hand Prioritize a candidate who is going to help people find work and the unemployment rate is a 10/10 on my "Oh Shit" Meter I am going to vote for that person.


We both want gay people to get married, It's just lower on my personal pecking order. We both also probably want older people to be able to fend for themselves before retirement. Does that make me a homophobe? Does that mean you hate the older working class who are socially immobile and set in their ways? Does it mean I want to hinder homosexuals? etc. Why are a specific portion of the population's rights more important than the economic prosperity of the entire country? I value their right to get married, but even if we help them we are only helping a specific percentage of people.

People are allowed to vote for their interests, and that's not an evil thing to do. It's when their interests are terrible that is an issue. But the people are not Donald Trump and Donald Trump's specific values that are exclusive to him do not represent the people who voted for them, who also have their own sets of specific values.

But let's set this argument aside. You're committing a fallacy. #1#[Reductio ad Hitlerum]#1#(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum) It's specifically about Hitler, but the actual fallacy part is the important piece. If I draw breath, and Hitler Drew breath, does that make me as bad as Hitler? If I share some of Donald Trumps qualities, does that make me as bad as Donald Trump? Obviously not.
