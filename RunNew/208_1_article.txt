FEDERATION FOR AMERICAN IMMIGRATION REFORM
March 2016

The greatest incentive for illegal aliens to come to the United States is to find work. If there are no employers willing to hire them, then the flood of illegal aliens will subside. #1#The Immigration and Reform Act of 1986 outlawed hiring illegal alien workers, although common practice has proven that measure ineffective for two reasons:#1#

The law requires proof that the employer knowingly hired the illegal worker. The prevalence of fake documents make it difficult to prove the employer knew that the employee’s work documents were not legitimate.

Historically, immigration law enforcement has been the exclusive province of federal law enforcement, but states are increasingly joining with the federal government in that effort and enacting legislation to punish employers for hiring violations. On January 1, 2008, an employer sanctions law took affect in Arizona. Business owners face the nation's first state law that requires employers to verify the work documents of their new employees. The law says any business that knowingly hires a worker who is in the country illegally will have its business license suspended. For a second offense, the business' license could be revoked. That is different from the federal penalties of fines and possible criminal prosecution that have been infrequently imposed for similar offenses.

The information below is taken from news sources. Each party in the report either confessed or was convicted of knowingly hiring illegal aliens. These cases are listed to illustrate the widespread abuse and increased prosecution of companies employing illegal aliens towards the end of the Bush Administration. Prosecutions that have continued in the Obama Administration are largely the culmination of investigations begun before the change in administration.
