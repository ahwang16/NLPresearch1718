GUESS HOW MANY OF TRUMP’S OWN SUPPORTERS THINK THAT HE’S A RACIST
#2#A new poll showing Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump by a decent margin also reveals that some of Trump’s own supporters consider him to be racist.#2#

Now, whether that’s coming from racists or people who have accepted that as a part of Trump’s character while holding their nose and rejecting Clinton, it’s still pretty significant.

Overall, 44 percent of those in the Suffolk University/USA Today poll say Trump is not a racist, while 47 percent say he is.

37 percent of white people think Trump is racist, compared to 61 percent of Hispanics and 83 percent of African-Americans.

But when you break it down by candidate, you have 77 percent of Clinton supporters calling Trump a racist while 7 percent of Trump supporters say the same.

Yes, 7 percent of people actively supporting Trump responded positively to the question “Do you think Donald Trump is a racist?”
