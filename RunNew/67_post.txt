#1#Even if Bloomberg takes a few red states, as long as Sanders can't get over 270 - which will be nearly impossible if Bloomberg wins a single blue state, or splits the vote enough to allow Trump to win a single blueish state like Virginia - Trump wins via the House.#1# Even if the House won't vote for Trump, which I find unlikely, Sanders still won't win.
