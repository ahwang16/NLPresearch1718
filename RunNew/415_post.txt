> Protesting against something as old and accepted as ~~a presidential election~~ the institution of slavery is poor character, instead of accepting the ~~outcome~~ status quo and working together.

See how much that argument doesn't hold? Argument ad antiquitatem is not a good argument at all.

>What are they protesting exactly? The election? It was fair and square. I didn't vote for Trump, but the outcome informs me on the general psyche of the American people, which I must accept.

The outcome is that the #1#[majority of people wanted Hillary Clinton in office]#1#(http://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-on-pace-to-win-popular-vote-despite-losing-election/) but an antequated system of the electoral college means that Donald Trump wins with a low margin.

>which I must accept.

That's just false: there's absolutely no reason that you must accept anything, ever. There may be consequences for *not* accepting some things, but if people can refuse to accept that autism isn't caused by vaccines, then the majority of the populus who voted for Hillary can refuse to accept a voting system that has been controversial for the last 20 years, at least, and speak out about it.

>because an outcome of a fair and democratic process

This is the crux of your dissonance: you insist that the electoral college is "fair and democratic" when in fact it is not, as can be seen plainly by the candidate who *lost the popular vote* didn't win the presidency. That is the very definition of undemocratic.
