>I don't see any basis for thinking we will be able to do things like that in time.

What?  You don't think we are developing technology that can be used to overcome a warming climate and limited biodiversity?  #1#[Here's one tech that would probably go a long way to helping us in the event of a mass extinction]#1#(https://www.fastcoexist.com/3044572/the-325000-lab-grown-hamburger-now-costs-less-than-12)  

We don't need a consensus in order to start developing the tech.  We just need some companies who see that profit could be made.  Giant companies can afford to have long lead time products and also products that may never make a profit.

This tech also overlaps greatly with tech for living on Mars and we're currently developing tech for that.

>It isn't that we're not moving fast enough; it's that we're moving very fast in the wrong direction with no signs of slowing.

This just isn't true.  Technology isn't going backwards.  Even if we are destroying are planet, technology is always moving forward and we are constantly developing new stuff.  Who knows what will be important when a mass extinction event comes, but I can imagine that tech that we already have and that we are developing for other purposes (like say Algae growth for biofuels) could come in handy in the event of mass extinction.
