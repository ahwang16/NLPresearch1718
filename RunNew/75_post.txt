You don't vote in a vacuum.

Often (as in this election) you are forced to chose between two evils: such as a candidate who may be sexist, racist and bigoted  and a candidate who is a corrupt-to-the core liar.

Picking option (1) does not make sexist, racist and bigoted, it just means that you see sexism / racism / bigotry as a lesser evil than unabashed political corruption.  

Tl/DR: #1#Picking between a giant douche and a turd sandwich - does not make either a douche or a turd.#1#
