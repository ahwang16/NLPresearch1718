Consider the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. The book is dominated by a single theme: the evil and immorality of slavery and upon publication, it ignited a firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery (who created a number of books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. #1#As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.#1# [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin#Reactions_to_the_novel)

Even though this book was just a novel and many people found it outrageous, it was still able to trigger a national debate on the morality of slavery.

I do agree that a large amount of reading is done just for entertainment and so in a lot of contexts is no better than TV.  But another more modern example, even though it was published 50 years ago, might be all the people that read Ayn Rand novels like Atlas Shrugged and become libertarians as a result.   People are still reading them today and adopting her political philosophies just based on the characters and situations that she discusses in her novels.

I tend to think that the author of novels tend to put more thought into abstract ideas they want to portray in their novels than TV, but of course there are plenty examples to the contrary like cheap romance novels.  Take a TV example of Star Trek the Next Generation where the main character would fly around and meet aliens who he'd try to understand.  People were always trying to jump to conclusions about situations, but he would always patiently try to sort out the details and find there were deeper truths to what motivated people.  It sends strong messages about how we should attempt to deal with people different than ourselves.  They also had anti-capitalist themes by demonstrating a society with no money but then having a race of aliens that were obsessed with money and showing the evil of that.  TV is also capable of changing political philosophies and making us question how we treat others.
