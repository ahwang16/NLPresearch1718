99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms,
64 percent of net new private-sector
jobs,
49.2 percent of private-sector
employment,

International Trade Administration; Bureau
of Labor Statistics, BED; Advocacy-funded
research, Small Business GDP: Update 20022010, www.sba.gov/advocacy/7540/42371.

How many small businesses are there?
In 2010 there were 27.9 million small
businesses, and 18,500 firms with 500
employees or more. Over three-quarters
of small businesses were nonemployers; this number has trended up over the
past decade, while employers have been
relatively flat (figure 1).

What is a small business?
The Office of Advocacy defines a small
business as an independent business
having fewer than 500 employees. For
the small business definition by industry used in government programs and
contracting, see www.sba.gov/content/
small-business-size-standards.
What percent of small businesses
operate as . . . ?
The many kinds of small businesses are
shown in table 1. The definitions overlap
so the shares total more than 100.

Frequently Asked Questions about Small Business

What is small businesses’ share of net
new jobs?
Small firms accounted for 64 percent of
the net new jobs created between 1993
and 2011 (or 11.8 million of the 18.5
million net new jobs). Since the latest
recession, from mid-2009 to 2011, small
firms, led by the larger ones in the category (20-499 employees), accounted for
67 percent of the net new jobs.
Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, BED. For
the latest employment statistics, see Advocacy’s quarterly reports, www.sba.gov/advocacy/10871.

How can small businesses’ share of
net new jobs be larger than their share
of employment, yet their share of
employment remains steady?
As firms grow, they change employment
size classes. So as small firms grow,
their growth counts toward small firm
job gains; but if they pass the 500-employee mark, their employment is classified as large firm employment.
Do the unemployed become self-employed?
When finding work is difficult, starting a business can be just as difficult
if not more so. But in March 2011, a
significant number of the self-employed,
5.5 percent or about 900,000, had been
unemployed in the previous year. This
figure was up from March 2006 and
March 2001, when it was 3.6 and 3.1
percent, respectively.

Which businesses create more jobs—
startups or existing businesses?
In the last two decades about 60 percent
of the private sector’s net new jobs have
been created by existing establishments
and about 40 percent from the churn
of startups minus closures. While firm
births account for many new jobs, job
losses from firm closures are equally
important in accounting for net effects to
employment levels.

What is the status of the startup market?
While the number of new employer
businesses has recovered from the recessionary dip, the average employment of
these businesses has been declining over
the past decade (figure 3).
How many businesses do women own?
While women-owned firms have increased as a share of total businesses
over the years, their size still remains
smaller than national averages. The 7.8
million women-owned firms averaged
$130,000 in receipts in 2007 (table 2).
How many businesses do minorities own?
Asian-owned businesses numbered 1.6
million in 2007 and have average receipts
of $290,000. African-American-owned
businesses numbered 1.9 million in 2007
and have average receipts of $50,000.
Hispanic-American-owned businesses
numbered 2.3 million in 2007 and have
average receipts of $120,000. Native
American/Islander-owned businesses
numbered 0.3 million in 2007 and have
average receipts of $120,000 (table 2).

What happens to the jobs created by
startups?
The total employment from a group of
startups is highest at birth and declines
as the firms age. Put another way, employment gains from growing businesses are less than employment declines
from shrinking and closing businesses
(figure 2).

Is youth entrepreneurship increasing?
Self-employment among younger age
groups has been dropping. From 2005 to
2010, self-employment among individuals age 25 and under decreased 19
percent (compared to a 7 percent drop
in the overall population). In contrast,
self-employment among those age 65
and over increased 24 percent over this
period as their population grew. Selfemployment rates increase with age; for

What are the home-based business
trends?
The share of firms that primarily operate out of the home was unchanged from
2002 to 2007 at 52 percent (the latest
figure available). Employers had a lower
share than nonemployers, 24 percent vs.
63 percent, respectively, in 2007. Of the
major industries, construction had the
highest share of home-based businesses,
70 percent. (Being home-based is not
synonymous with working at home.) It is
interesting to note that retail trade went
from 49 percent home-based in 2002 to
44 percent in 2007 while the share of
Internet retail sales went from 1 percent
to 3 percent of total retail sales.

How does franchise survival compare
with independent business survival?
Survival among independent businesses
and franchises appears to be similar, as
they have similar age distributions. Of
course each potential business owner
debating an independent business or
franchise arrangement will have unique
factors to weigh, such as their managerial talent and sales abilities.

research/rs330tot.pdf. Note that about half of
the franchises in the data were nonemployers,
which may not be the stereotypical franchise
that individuals imagine.

How many businesses open and close
each year?
About 10-12 percent of firms with employees open each year and about 10-12
percent close (table 3). Employer firm
births were down and deaths were up in
the most recent available data because
of the downturn. But establishment birth
figures from 2011 show gains (figure 4).
Nonemployer firms have turnover rates
three times as high as employer firms,
mostly because it is easier for nonemployers to start and stop, as they tend to
be smaller than employer firms. Business bankruptcies numbered 48,000 in
2011, a decline of the about 60,000 over
the previous two years. Note that not all
firm deaths are business bankruptcies,
and many business owners file personal
bankruptcy instead of business bankruptcy.
Page 3

What is the survival rate for new
businesses?
About half of all new establishments
survive five years or more and about
one-third survive 10 years or more.
As one would expect, the probability
of survival increases with a firm’s age.
Survival rates have changed little over
time (figure 5).
How do small and large businesses
compare on innovation?
Of high patenting firms (15 or more in
a four-year period), small businesses
produced 16 times more patents per
employee than large patenting firms.
Research also shows that increasing the
number of employees correlates with
increased innovation while increasing
sales does not.

How are business churn and the economy
related?
Business churn (the sum of the firm
birth and death rates) tends to follow
the change in GDP with a six-quarter
lag (figure 6). Recently, churn has been
down, which may be a response to the
general decline in output.

16% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN SOUTH CAROLINA WILLING TO TELL POLLSTERS THEY ARE OPENLY WHITE SUPREMACIST
#2#16% of Trump Supporters in South Carolina Willing to Tell Pollsters They Are Openly White Supremacist#2#

Only 14% are not sure if whites are the superior race.

A new Public Policy Poll released today shows a sizable chunk of Donald Trump's support in South Carolina is from white supremacists. When asked by the pollsters if they believe whites are the superior race, 16% of Trump supporters answered "yes." The candidate with the second highest support among white supremacists was Marco Rubio with 9%, followed by Ted Cruz at 7%.

One percent of Ben Carson supporters, despite the fact that Carson is African American, admitted to being white supremacists.

The poll also shows Trump's lead in South Carolina has remained virtually unchanged since the debate last week. Many pundidts thought Trump "lost" the debate, but like almost every other time experts said Trump's lead would slide, they were proven wrong. Trump maintains a commanding 35% of the vote, with Cruz and Rubio coming in at 18% and 10%, respectively.

The race in South Carolina remains fluid with 29% of voters saying they may change their minds. "Establishment" pick Marco Rubio needs to eat into Trump and Cruz's sizable leads if he's going to maintain his frontrunner status, justified or not. After giving a "victory" speech after finishing third place in Iowa, Rubio wildly underperformed in New Hampshire, emailing a rambling apology to his supporters.

#2#The poll also found that 62% of Trump voters support a national database for Muslims, with the next closest Marco Rubio at 47%. A whopping 56% of Trump supporters don't think the religion of Islam should be legal, with 33% wanting to ban it outright.#2# The next closest was Ted Cruz with 27%.

With his open xenophobia and Muslim-bashing, it's no secret that Trump is tapping into a racist streak in American politics, but this poll provides some concrete evidence that his rhetoric is actually attracting a sizable amount of open racists. We can also assume there is some percentage of South Carolina Republicans who believe whites are superior, but wouldn't admit it to a pollster.
