"Smug mocking" is not a short term strategy, but a long-term one. You're sort of missing the forest for the trees: what you see as a tactic for winning, I see as a tactic for social change. Think about it for a second. Why did public health campaigns against smoking work? They worked because the message was *ubiquitous* and *clear*: it's advertising 101, and as a Trump supporter you of all people should recognize that since Trump is a master of this (i.e. advertising himself to people with a clear message, expressing contempt for the "right" people [e.g. the system/status quo], etc). 

The "smugness" and "condescension" are a much broader cultural strategy. Ben Shapiro talks a lot about this, if you're interested in the quasi-intellectual (it's not a scholarly argument, which is why I say 'quasi'; that's not a dig at him at all, or I would have said 'pseudo') argument about this from a conservative angle. We witnessed during this election only a snapshot of a broader cultural strategy to make some things fashionable and other things unfashionable. e.g. You don't want transgender rights? "ugh, so backwards and [insert contemptuous language here]". 

I hate to break it to you, but the strategy seems to be working. Younger generations are much more "politically correct" than older generations, in part because of the social pressure generated by this cultural strategy. Gay marriage is the law of the land, for crying out loud--surely you don't attribute that to anything other than a broad, systematic shift in cultural attitudes (it seems to have gone from "Gay marriage is fundamentally bad for our society" to "Live and let live, but don't tread on my right to still personally believe it's immoral [see cases about catering gay weddings, for example]". That's a powerful shift, and I think it has to do with the fact that society has put pressure on those who opposed Gay marriage by making moral arguments against them (which often feel cruel, condescending, etc). 

And that's the fundamental point, I think. When it's a moral argument, there's almost always "smugness; condescension; shaming; and cruelty". This is because morality is not rational: all morality is based on assumptions whether we want to admit it or not, and so once we start having disagreements about those assumptions, there's nothing left to rationally argue about. This results in a tautological cycle where we use morality to argue morality: 

*("You're a bad human being for believing in this bad morality". "Why does that make me a bad human being?" "Because you believe in that bad morality". "But how do you know it makes me bad?" "Because only bad people can believe in that bad morality". etc. etc. ad nauseum)*.  

The truth is that this tactic is working quite well. Shaming and social manipulation generally is one of the single best ways we have of keeping our fellow human beings in line with things that are otherwise not necessarily objectively provable. Since so much of our lives are governed by these non-objective things, this is a ubiquitous phenomenon. If you don't believe me, try going to one of those young-people religious lectures in a college campus. You know the ones I'm talking about: the bubbly, excited Christians who invite the "young, cool, hip preacher" to encourage people to keep their faith. Go there and try to engage the preacher in a rational discussion: you'll find *immediate* condescension; smugness; and dismissal-through-humor tactics, because that's how the message sinks in. It's a tactic of social shaming and control, and don't make the mistake of believing it does not work. 

What you are seeing from liberals is a socio-cultural tactic of broad, large-scale cultural scale. The backlash to this change is only a symptom of the underlying process.#1# Political Science research has shown, for example, that [increased and severe terrorist attacks can be a sign of weakening rather than strengthening]#1#(http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2016/05/19/isis-attacks-abroad-sign-weakness/). Harsh backlash should be viewed very carefully; I contend that this harsh backlash of Trump is masking an underlying phenomenon, which is that liberals have been "winning" the culture games for the past several decades. Whether this trend continues is anyone's guess, but you should not think of these otherwise manipulative social tactics you're decrying are part of a short-term electoral strategy. Rather, they are part of a much larger, longer-scale cultural strategy--and make no mistake about it, they are working exactly as they are supposed to.

ISIS INCREASED ATTACKS ABROAD ARE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
ISIS Increased Attacks Abroad are a Sign of Weakness

On March 22, terror struck Brussels with a twin blast at Zaventem Airport and the Maelbeek metro station, claiming the lives of 32 people and injuring over 300. The attacks claimed by ISIS came only a few days after a suicide bombing killed five and injured 36 in Istanbul—the fourth suicide bombing in Turkey in 2016.

The latest bombings have reheated the debate within the EU about tighter border controls—possibly foreshadowing the eventual breakdown of the Schengen Agreement. In addition, the attacks have hardened Europe’s determination to combat terrorism at home, with increased monitoring of ISIS fighters returning from the Middle East and improved intelligence sharing between EU members, and abroad, whether through ramping up aircraft deployments in the coalition against the Islamic State or by supplying weapons to local actors.

#1#Experts have argued that ISIS’s increased activity abroad is a sign of weakness rather than strength.#1# As the so-called caliphate begins to crumble—ISIS is thought to have lost around 20% of its territory in Syria and over 40% in Iraq since its peak expansion in August 2014—the group is allocating efforts and resources toward large-scale terrorist attacks abroad in order to influence the strategic calculations of the coalition member countries at a reduced cost.

Since ISIS’s “winner’s message” of “remaining and expanding” sounds increasingly hollow, this tactical shift is one way to catch global headlines and retain its legitimacy and ability to recruit.

Although the increased operational tempo of terrorist attacks is the manifestation of the group’s faltering, the ISIS underlying ideology is not expected to wither away anytime soon. Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism finance analyst at the Treasury Department, argues that “defeating the formal military presence of a terrorist group will not significantly mitigate the threat of lone wolf or small independent cells that are based in the West.”

In its heartland, ISIS is definitely in retreat. According to Pentagon officials, U.S. airstrikes have killed over 25,000 Islamic State fighters and deprived the group of millions of dollars in revenue. Financially debilitated, it has halved salaries of its civil servants and is releasing hostages for sums as low as $500.

Indeed, ISIS has not scored a significant victory since taking Palmyra in May 2015. The ancient city was recaptured by the Syrian regime, supported by Russian airstrikes, on March 27, 2016, reducing ISIS’s ability to threaten Syria’s coastal regions.

In Iraq, after retaking Tikrit in March 2015 and Ramadi in December, the government in Baghdad declared on March 24 the beginning of operations to retake Mosul. The offensive to regain Iraq’s second largest city will not be easy.

After some initial success reclaiming nearby villages, progress in the military campaign was stalled. More sober prognostics have now replaced the once optimistic talks of pushing ISIS out of Mosul by the end of the year—military analysts estimate that there is little prospect of an assault on the city before 2017.

With about 10,000 fighters and almost two years to erect a multilayered defense, a force of at least 40,000 would be needed to overcome the group, according to estimates. Indeed, the current under-strength Iraqi division supported by U.S. military advisers looks woefully inadequate for the task.

Moreover, because of ethno-religious tensions, Kurdish Peshmerga seem uninterested in helping take a city that would never be part of an independent Kurdistan while Shi‘a-dominated militias—instrumental in retaking Tikrit—will probably be kept away for fears of sectarian reprisals following the conquest of the Sunni-majority city.

An important factor in the battle for Mosul is America’s involvement. The Pentagon wants to go beyond air strikes and the current deployment of military advisers and introduce additional special forces. However, this goes against Obama’s “no boots on the ground” pledge—although an increasingly tenuous promise, it rules out the deployment on the scale necessary to retake Mosul.

After attempting to train local forces—leading to the disastrous $500 million train-and-equip program for Syrian moderates that yielded little to no results—and bombing oil production facilities under Operation Tidal Wave II, the U.S. is now focusing on a leadership decapitation campaign, using special forces on the ground. In March, American forces killed Haji Iman, ISIS’s second-in-command, as well as Abu Omar al-Shishanim, the group’s “war minister.”

Secretary of Defense Ash Carter explained current U.S. strategy: “we are systematically eliminating ISIL’s cabinet,” in order to “hamper the ability for them to conduct operations inside and outside of Iraq and Syria.” Although the leadership is capable of regenerating itself and operating on the ground, taking out leaders reduces the group’s ability to conduct terrorist attacks abroad as they require a more sophisticated network and superior coordination.

Talks of a new training program—allegedly more narrowly focused—and Obama’s decision to add 250 military personnel to the 50 already on the ground in Syria are the latest development in the U.S. effort to capitalize on the momentum in the campaign against the Islamic State. It remains to be seen whether or not these new policies achieve the desired outcome.
