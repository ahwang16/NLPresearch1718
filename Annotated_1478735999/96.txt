>He wouldn't have inspired black/hispanic turnout.

Okay, this is such a ridiculous argument, because...

Do you know why Clinton lost? **SHE DIDN'T INSPIRE WHITE TURNOUT**. This is why the Democrats lost. All the focus for the Democrats was on nonwhite people. The whole narrative of the Democratic party was that minority voters were going to propel Clinton to victory. There was literally no mention of white voters being important to Democrats. The Democratic Party mantra was basically saying that they don't care about white voters and are just hoping the demographics of the country continue to change so that whites decrease as a percentage of the population so that Republicans can no longer win presidential elections. Do you understanding how upsetting and frustrating that is to white people? That Democrats literally just want to ignore and them and hope they go away? Clinton only received 36% of the white vote in a country that is 70% white. How pathetic is that?

The biggest changes this election were not among minorities. It was among white people. So many white counties that Obama won in double digit margins in 2012 flipped to Trump this time around. Most of the swing states are more white than the national average of 70%:

New Hampshire: 94% white
* Iowa: 92%
* Wisconsin and Colorado: 88%
* Ohio and Pennsylvania: 83%

So let's see, which candidate in the Democratic primary was stronger among white people? Bernie Sanders. In Michigan in particular, Bernie Sanders received 56% of the white vote in the primary. In Wisconsin, 59%.

Even in South Carolina, where Bernie lost in a massive blowout (73%-26%), he still received 46% of the white vote. He outright won among white men in South Carolina, at 56%.

THIS was exactly what the Democratic Party needed this time around. Badly. Instead, we got Clinton, who spent most of her oppo attacking Trump for being a racist. She called Trump supporters "deplorables". Calling people racist does not motivate them to vote for you.

But let's ignore white people, as the Democrats did, and focus on black voters instead. Even if we do that, we can see that Hillary was a failure here too.

Her support among black voters in the general election was only slightly lower than Obama's. Why? Because she lost the black **Bernie supporters**. Bernie's strongest state in terms of black voters was Missouri, at 32%... Next highest? **Wisconsin**. He received 31% of the black vote there. Guess where else he also received 30% of the black vote? **Pennsylvania**. He got the same number in Illinois. His next best state? **Michigan** with 28% of the black vote. Which state is next? **Ohio**, with 28% of the black vote. So in other words, where Bernie had his BEST showing among black voters in competitive states, Hillary lost in the general election. 

[Here's a map using every state that had exit polling where black voters could give given a percentage](http://imgur.com/a/MB9nZ). I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that Bernie would have won Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan in the general election. He was able to tap specifically into the black voters who stayed home this general election in those states. He might have even been able to make Missouri competitive.
