> I don't know if I believe this.

Why not?  The businesses that higher undocumented labor are ones where the demand for labor isn't as static - you don't have a good idea the number of employees working on any given day.  If I show up to your business and you have the undocumented laborers run out the back, how do I prove that you had undocumented labor on your payroll?

You say fast food doesn't have this issue, but it is a real problem in the restaurant industry - bussers, cooks and dishwashers all have high undocumented laborer rates.

>But if we look at the root cause of the problem

Sometimes the solution to the root problem is too difficult to solve so we have to go for a less effective, but actionable, solution.
