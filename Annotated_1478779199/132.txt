Saying =/= doing

Definition of misogyny, according to my Google Dictionary addon is:

>#1#[Misogynous: hating women in particular]#1#(http://imgur.com/PDVURmr)

Misogyny can not be determined by one action. It is a series of actions and beliefs that women are worse than men. #1#Donald Trump makes fun of [**EVERYONE**](http://www.dailywire.com/news/10120/trump-has-called-numerous-men-nasty-guys-so-stop-frank-camp#), not just women.#1# That's his shtick.

TRUMP HAS CALLED NUMEROUS MEN 'NASTY GUYS,' SO STOP CRYING 'SEXISM'
There were several memorable moments from Wednesday's presidential debate, but one that caught fire on social media is when Donald Trump referred to Hillary Clinton as "a nasty woman" while she was describing her tax plan.

As if connected via hive-mind, the SJW community flooded social media after the debate with you-go-girl sympathy, and cries of "sexism!"

From one #NastyWoman to another, you were an inspiration last night, @HillaryClinton. -NP — Team Pelosi (@TeamPelosi) October 20, 2016

@Reuters It wraps up his attitude towards women and his racism in a neat little bow! #BullyTrump #UnfitForHumanity — Wendy (@AtlanticCanuck) October 20, 2016

@UzoAduba It's crazy that "No One Respects Women More Than Me" comes out of the same mouth. #debatenight — Sherry Kondor (@SherryKondor) October 20, 2016

@businessinsider he confirmed once more how much he hates women, how low he goes, and how disrespectful he will always be. — Ala (@AlaBensasi) October 20, 2016

Here's the thing, though. #1#It wasn't sexist. Donald Trump, despite legitimate charges of sexism in other instances, has said the exact same thing about men on multiple occasions--specifically Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).#1#

Speaking with George Stephanopoulos:

"Look, the truth is he's a nasty guy, nobody likes him, nobody in Congress likes him, nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him...very nasty guy."

Speaking with CNN's Wolf Blitzer:

"Ted cannot get along with anybody. He's a nasty person."

During a primary debate on CBS:

"Nasty guy! Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues."

The above are just three examples of many times Donald Trump referred to Ted Cruz as a "nasty guy." But it doesn't stop there.

Trump called Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, a "nasty guy." He also called The Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold a "nasty guy." It seems to be his go-to insult.

It can be debated whether or not it's a nice thing to say, or if such language is appropriate among presidential candidates, but Trump calling Clinton a "nasty woman" simply can't be labeled "sexist."
