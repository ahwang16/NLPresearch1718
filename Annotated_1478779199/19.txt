In this past election, millions of eligible Americans did not come out to vote.  Millions more in the primaries as well.  #1#This interactive from the NYT shows what percentage of eligible voters actually went out to nominate Trump and Clinton.#1#

In the recent referendum to vote "Leave" for the UK, many Remain supporters stated they didn't bother coming out because they didn't think that Leave would actually win.  All around me I see a slightly similar phenomenon with the 2016 Presidential Election.  Had more individuals come out to the primaries, neither Trump nor Clinton would have been nominated.

ONLY 9% OF AMERICA CHOSE TRUMP AND CLINTON AS THE NOMINEES
103 million of them are children, noncitizens or ineligible felons, and they do not have the right to vote.

Estimates for ineligible felons are from 2010.
