I have to say that I am very disappointed with the current state of political discourse in today's society. Both in mass media and the Internet, political discussion seems to be ruled by angry extremists who think that the other side is evil and shout down, insult and in some case censor anyone who doesn't think so. Many times over I've dealt with those types of people (both from the left and the right) only to find out that reason and logic rarely, if ever work on them. Their extreme views also focus a lot of outrage (sometimes from other extremists), often derailing the discussion from the original topic.

So I have a question: Do you guys this can be fixed? Or is this just [the GIFT in practise?](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/archives/pictures/greater_internet_fuckwad_theory.jpg)
